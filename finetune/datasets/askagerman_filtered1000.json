He's angry. He blames others for his actions. He felt way more real, while still having a somehow lovely character.

Geeman schools have them too, but those are rudimentary, cuz these activities are usually done outside of school in youth groups and clubs. I kinda prefer the American way having everything at school making joining and participating easier.\n\nEducation-wise, I went to a higher grade in the US than in Germany like junior aka 11th grade and even had some senior and AP classes and most of what they had in the curriculum including exams was (excuse me) a joke compared to 10th grade Gymnasium here in Germany, esp. maths was incredibly basic, years behind German students. I know everyone goes to high school in the US, but the difference in most subjects was just baffling. I've been told the same thing by fellow exchange students from Europe. Apparently what we learn in secondary school is only taught at college undergrad level.\n\nAlso surprised by the amount of students falling asleep in class and teachers not caring the slightest bit. :D\n\nI picked up how students are prepared to apply for college in school.

You can even see the divide between East and West Berlin on this map.   \n\nThe only other map I have seen that was comparable to this one was [this map](https://external-preview.redd.it/h0ZlcnQcLpWLK5evKrl7oc6vn9PLBvPStD0sv1PNO7o.png?auto=webp&amp;s=11d997b64d6d2d00b8b40cadc4582cd29744eef0) of Die Linke's support, which also appears very restricted to East Germany, but at least I can understand the historical reasons why people from a former communist country would support the successor to the party that used to run it (and why people from West Germany would be reluctant to vote for it).\n\nThe states in which the AfD seems to do well in local elections are also mostly in what was formerly East Germany: Sachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt, Th√ºringen, Brandenburg, etc.\n\nWhile Die Linke's regional support makes sense to me, the AfD's regionalism is very mysterious.  Why would they appeal to voters specifically from East Germany, but be politically irrelevant in places like Niedersachsen and Schleswig-Holstein?",
    "output": "I'm not a German, but I wrote my undergraduate thesis on this very topic. There's a bunch of different reasons for the regional differences in support for the AfD, but I'd argue that economics and the relative lack of extant migrant populations are two of the main reasons for the success of the AfD in the former east. \n\nFirst, economics: it's no secret that even 30 years after the Wiedervereinigung, the former east is poorer than the former west. People who feel their economic livelihood is threatened by immigration are receptive to political parties that are explicitly anti immigration.\n\nSecond, extant migrant populations: immigration to the former East Germany was quite limited, while the former West Germany imported vast quantities of Gastarbeiter from the 1950s-1973, meaning that there's a fairly large minority population in the former west, but not the former east. I'd suggest reading Hopkins' Politicized Places (2010), although it's about immigration to the US, it does a good job of explaining why immigration is sometimes politicized and sometimes not. Essentially it boils down to, it's harder to hate immigrants (and therefore vote for parties or policies that are expressly anti immigration) if you interact with immigrants often."

But party dynamics in general have been shifting a lot in the last few years.

A new hard-right party has appeared (the AfD), and the social democrats are hemorrhaging votes like crazy. \n\nI would say that it is currently pretty unclear what will happen in our next election (which is this year!), and the question of who will be chancellor is only one of the many questions here.

There are easier ways to do it. Like refugees. We took something like a million Syrian refugees. It's probably easier to snatch one of those than getting your kidneys.\n\nThe only thing I'd worry about is whether or not your skills are marketable in Germany. Startups go bankrupt, that's just how it is, and you might want to have a plan B if you don't want to go home should this happen. Nothing else to worry about. So learn German, and look around Berlin if there's something for you.\n\nIf you're a software developer (Python or TS/Angular preferably) hit me up if you're looking for something in the future. We're are right before our Series A and it's looking good so we are going to hire a lot in the next 2 years and our chances for not going bankrupt look good.\n\nAlso, I really dislike how people are clowning you in this thread. I work with some guys from Latin America. Very simple things like riding your bike at night through a forest, letting your child play in the playground, letting your child go outside at all alone, going on a road trip to a remote area were all things that scared them when they came to Germany because those things are simply not safe to do where they're from. A lot of those didn't even care for going to Germany. Their requirement was \"not my home country\" and Germany, with the \"everything has to be in order attitude\" was just a super easy country to emigrate to with clear rules and clear paths to get a visa. Can you imagine being so eager to leave your home country that you just say \"I don't care where just not here\"?\n\nYou guys need to be more aware of your privileges as Germans. How lucky we are to be born in a country, or a continent really, where you can enjoy life without having to fear for something to happen to you that we only know from Hollywood action movies. What we find ridiculously paranoid is a real concern for some people and the least we can do is giving people that worry reassuring words."

Would you think someone is weird if they referred to their cat as their stubentiger? Would it be used in formal speech, only between friends, only when talking to their cat, or in a different way?\n\nPersonally I love it and will continue to call my cat a stubentiger in an awful accent, but I wanted to know what actual Germans thought of the word.",
    "output": "Yes, it's a real word. It's not formal speech. If you write a biology book then obviously don't call a house cat a Stubentiger. Basically any public **and** formal setting like news report should stay clear of this language, because it might confuse people. \n\nStubentiger is just an endearing or cheeky way of saying (house) cat, instead of just cat. Just like some people refer to small fluffy dogs, with preferably white fur, as \"Ofenrohrputzer\". Apart from formal settings it doesn't matter if you use it or not. It can be used in an opinion piece in a magazine about house cats or some comedy skit.\n\nAs for it's usage some use it, some don't. I don't know if there is a regional divide in it's usage."

    "output": "When me and my mom moved to the US when I was a kid, I used these methods:\n\n1. Learning programms. I used a computer programm for about 1-2 hours a day to learn english. There are tons of free options in the app store (like Duolingo for example).\n\n2. Carry a translator book or app with you and look up words you don't understand. Don't just sit there nodding and assuming you might know what it means. You'll be suprised how many new words you'll learn over time.\n\n3. Consume every type of media in the language you want to learn. This worked great for me with spanish for example. I finished Season 1 of Narcos without any English or German and learned many new words.\n\n4. Try to communicate with native born locals rather than expats or people from other backgrounds. What some migrants do wrong in countries they just move to, is to group up with people from the same heritage/cultural background. While this in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing, I probably don't have to explain how counter productive this is for language learning.\n\n5. Don't let the language barrier or the entry learning level of the German language bring you down. Lets be clear: German is one of the hardest languages to learn. If native speakers hear you talk with an accent, they won't necessarily make fun of you or else. Rather, they're going to be happy you try to learn it, than not. Once you start don't go back."

    "output": "On the cultural side the East-West divide is being slowly lost to the stronger North-South divide that has a lot more history behind it.\n\n\"Conservative\" is a difficult term here. While there are differences, they encompass different things that are generally called \"conservative\". East Germans are generally more liberal concerning public nudity, sexuality in general, or the fact that divorce isn't considered to be shameful. West Germans generally are more liberal concerning immigration matters.\n\nConcerning economy it's a thing of context. West Germany just is one of the most wealthy regions on the planet. Compared to that East Germany is less wealthy. However East Germany still is wealthier than EU average.  \nFor \"normal\" people the incomes also are fairly similar in both regions, however there are more high earners in the West as most HQs of the large corporations are there. There is a clearly visible difference in family wealth, though."

Almost forgotten. And not \"empty\" in a positive sense like it's Sunday morning and people are sleeping, I mean actually empty like everyone just left. There was a very tangible depressive mood all around, and people younger than 40 seemed few and far between.\n\nLeipzig and Dresden were nice exceptions, as they actually gave me a positive vibe of young, growing, thriving cities. But even then, they still felt a lot \"emptier\" than most cities of comparable size in the western states. A lot more parking space, a lot less traffic and fewer people on the streets especially after dark. But that might also just be due to different urban planning choices.\n\nIs it just my totally baseless impression? How does it actually feel to live in the eastern states nowadays, outside of the large cities where I guess things are mostly the same as in any other city in Germany?",
    "output": "Your impression is not wrong. \n\nFor starters, some of the rural regions in East Germany always had a lower than average population, even as far back as the 18th and 19th century. Part of the reason is poor soil that is difficult to farm and that cannot sustain as many people as in other regions. \n\nA lot of the massive growth that Berlin saw in the late 19th and early 20th century were people from an area of around 250 kilometers around Berlin moving into the city. So Berlin has always been an island of population in an area that was less populous than average. During and after WWII people left Berlin. East Germans moved to East Berlin, but with the housing program this only meant that East Berlin sprawled to the East. \n\nDresden and Saxony in general saw some early industrialisation and thus population growth, but a lot of this industrialisation was driven by the markets in Silesia. After WWII Saxony was cut off from that historic connection, which lead to a collapse in industry.  Similar is true for area around Leipzig, traditionally products made in Leipzig were sold as far as Frankfurt am Main.  \n\nThe East German government had the gigantic task to revive this industry. They did alright in the 1950s and early 1960s by building a lot of new factories, but by the mid-1980s those factories were often aged and desperate need of repair. \n\nThose economic troubles drove people from East Germany to West Germany. The politics of the East German government did not help. It is estimated that between 1945 and 1961 East Germany lost approx 4.5 million people who migrated to West Germany. It was the main reason they build the Berlin Wall in the first place, to stop the massive drain of educated, working-age people to West Germany. \n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall, that migration picked up again. People moved to West Germany for jobs. \n\nA city like Halle (Saale) lost over 70.000 inhabitants of the course of 30 years, that is enormous. \n\nWhat is even more worrying: those young people who left aren't coming back. They found jobs and partners elsewhere and while they might want to come back, that would usually mean taking a significant paycut."

For example in the US, while most states have an income tax, a few states have no income tax, and make up the difference by taxing more on property taxes or sales taxes (We don't have VAT).\n\nSome taxes vary from state to state, or even city to city, but not all. VAT are federal. There are tax differences, at least for companies, between the different states, but don't ask me which one. \n\n&gt; Does each state have the same type of legislative, executive, and judicial system or does each state have unique implementation of them? Like would one state have only one legislative body, while another might have an upper and lower legislature. \n\nJudicial system is a bit complicated. While each state uses the same system, the judges are employed by the state. The differences are only administrational, so you won't notice it as civilian, but when you work in the legal field, you might see the differences.\n\nEach state has its own legislative and executive bodies. Most direct contact between state and citizens happen on the state level, because oven most of the federal laws are enforced by state officials. The states are quite free how to set up their executive, but they have to fulfil the enforcement of the laws that was given to them by the federal body.\n\nThat said, nearly all states have the same system, with the exeption being the city states, as they have a few more unique interpretation of the theme that is set up. But in general, every state has one legislative body and the executive next to it. They have a minister president / major as the head of the executive and the ministers under it.\n\n&gt; Do the individual states handle most of the criminal prosecution or is that mainly handled by the federal government?\n\nMost of the criminal prosecution is state level, with the exception when the law involves the federal prosecutor. But that is only the case for murder and other high crimes and crimes against the state. The prisons are also state level.\n\n&gt; Finally, when you cross from one state to the next, do you have road signs that welcome you to the state?

Like did anyone have major issues with it? Did anyone have annoyances with it? Did anyone find it convenient as soon as you could use it, or even lucrative? Does any keep old currency around for collectors or sentimental reasons, regardless of country of origin?\n\nI'm really interested in anecdotal information from the people here. Like how it affected you or parents, or your family, or your friends.",
    "output": "Almost all of my family were against Euro. Because the DM was seen as a stable currency.  So there were some issues about that. The mayor issue however was that the new banknotes felt so cold due to the lack of people, landscapes, plants or animals (for a good reason tbh) \nThe starter kits (plastic bag with a few coins woth 10.33‚Ç¨, sold for 20DM, so you made 33cent buying it, *kaching*) came in December and some people instantly had to check if the cigarette machine takes the coins (It did in most cases) And then there was the waiting till new year. \n\nAt 1.Jan.2001 00:15 there was a queue at the ATM and sad faces that it still gives DM. So we had to wait till the banks opened to get the new banknotes. I was fascinated by the colour changing 50 on the 50‚Ç¨ note.\nThen there was the 2 month where you could use both currencies. That was a big mess: We changed almost everything in the first week but some didn't. Paying needed extra time because of the two currencies. (Paying with card was very rare that time in Germany) Once we waited extra long at the bakery because a woman had not enough cash in neither DM nor Euro to pay the groceries so they tried to split the amount because in the sum she had enough money....\n\nIn the radio there were thousands of silly jokes like: \"Why did Danmark not took the Euro? - Because nobody wants to live in Daneuro\" That was horrible, You don't believe how many German words have the syllable -mark- by coincidence in them...\n\nAfter the two months it settled. There was the feeling and the fear that the supermarkets are raising the prices with the change. The word  \"Teuro\"  (made of \"teuer\" = expensive and Euro ) became popular in media. And my parents believed that (in fact there was no such effect in general besides the usual inflation, speaking of that: the inflation remained low)\n\nFor a long period you heard the adults say \"in my mind i convert everything into DM to realise the real price\" It eventually died out but if one wants to express how expensive something is, they say something like: \"300‚Ç¨ that are 600DM!\" However this is a German thing due to the simple conversion 1:2.\n\nIn my family the Euro became more accepted after the first vacation abroad without foreign currency and suddenly I have heard the sentence: \"i think one European currency is good for companies trading abroad\" In the years the Euro became normal and my family won't return to DM if they could, however they still think the DM notes and coins were prettier."

Germany has ended up as the place I'd love to move to as I've always peeked into German media, and have been trying ^((have been slowly picking up on words/grammar but am too lazy to find a good learning source)) to learn the language. For around the past half year its been a constant conflict in my mind whether or not I should move to Germany for College or if I'm being my same ambitious self. (maybe there's something I dont understand yet)\n\nSomething that's recently popped up is a scholarship in Florida that pays up to 100% of college fees for colleges **only in Florida** if you get a good SAT score. This is one of the main things telling to me to stay here but honestly, I don't want to. Whenever I think of this I have a thought in the back of my head telling me not doing this is a mistake as it saves a lot of money.\n\nOn the other hand, I want to live my early adult life in Germany, as I could get used to the area earlier in life. I had the idea of going to an English speaking college and learn enough German to be able to do basic life things as I dont think I can learn enough German in &lt; 3 years to understand a college class. \n\nMy dad seems to be supporting of moving, don't know about my mother, and my brother was the main one who told me to go for the scholarship.\n\n* So my main questions are:\n\n1. Should I wait longer to see what happens, keep my eye on Germany, or stay in the US?\n2. Am I being to ambitious?\n3. Is there something I dont understand/know yet?\n\nAlso is it better for me to post this on an advice subreddit?",
    "output": "You are asking the wrong questions. Instead of trying to making decisions about moving to Germany or staying in the USA, I would first make sure that you even got the option to move to Germany in the first place. \n\nThere are several requirements that you need to fullfill if you want to study at a German university, one of them is doing a certain combination of AP classes and getting good grades in those. \n\nLook up those rules on anabin.kmk.org and choose your subjects and classes in highschool accordingly. Otherwise this is all moot. \n\nThe good thing is that the same things that would help you become a student in Germany will also help you gain scholarships in the USA, so get cracking on that. \n\nAnd no, you are not too ambitious. It is possible, but you need to bust your ass. \n\nRegarding learning German: you can definitely learn enough German in 3 years for it to be useful if you put in the work. It won't be quite university level, but this is nothing that a study-prep course in Germany or a year as an Au-Pair won't fix. See r/German for more info. Due to your age I would also apply for scholarships to do an exchange year in Germany. \n\nThird consideration: Money. While German universities are tuition-free, you still need money for food and rent. The German government asks you to prove that you got 10k EUR per year or you won't get a student visa. By the time you will be a student, this might have gone up to 11k. AFAIK you cannot get a student loan from a US bank to study at a German university and unless you have German citizenship, you are not eligible for Baf√∂G, the German student aid. There are some Fulbright scholarships, but most foreign students are bankrolled by Mom and Dad. So have a chat with your parents about your plans to study in Germany. You should have savings in the neighborhood of 24k EUR. You need 10k for the first year in Germany with Studienkolleg and language classes and the next 10k for being an actual student. Yes, you can work part-time as a student, but it is an extremely bad plan to rely on income from working to finance your studies. \n\nIt is slightly different for Masters. If you get good grades on your bachelors you can apply for a DAAD scholarshop for doing your masters in Germany. Just note that competition for those is fierce. If you are serious about moving to Germany, my recommendation would be having a back-up plan on how to finance your masters, ideally that back-up plan would be savings."

    "output": "&gt; So my actual question is, are Germans just really into bread?\n\nYes. Bread is *by far* the number one thing that Germans miss when they move abroad. Not beer or sausages or whatever. Bread.\n\nAlso note that Germans tend to have sliced bread with toppings multiple times a day. It's the traditional breakfast and supper, and also the most common food in between meals. The only hot meal in the day (traditionally) is lunch, and that's the only one that doesn't revolve around bread.\n\nMost people buy their bread in a bakery (either stand alone, or a bakery stall in the entrance area of a grocery store). Buying pre-packaged sliced bread in the grocery store is pretty unusual, except for \"toast bread\" (bread meant to be toasted, the type of bread that's common in the US, spongy soft white bread), which isn't really seen as normal bread to begin with.\n\nA variation is bread rolls and things like pretzels. Those are also common breakfast and snack foods, and you also buy them at the bakery.\n\n[This](https://baeckerei-keim.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3026_4.jpg) is what a typical bakery looks like.

If so which area do you recommend?. \n\nI'm (16F) graduating highschool in 2023 so I have a bit of time to decide. Do you recommend Germany as a safe place to live in? I'm worried about my race being a problem.\n\n\nEdit: I live in The Bahamas in the Caribbean.\n\nEdit 2: I plan to attend university there as well.\n\nThank you for the Silver!!!",
    "output": "*Generally* yes, it's safe. Frankly, it's a little less safe for you than for a white person because racist idiots do exist, but overall it's still safer than most other places. I don't know where you live now, but there is a high chance you will be safer in Germany *despite* being less safe than other people in Germany.\n\nPeople will stare. Not because you're black but because we stare, or rather, we're perceived that way by people from many other countries because we apparently make eye contact with strangers and hold it for a split second longer than people in some other places. People who aren't white often misinterpret that as racism, and in general, some foreigners feel like there must be something about them in particular that makes other people stare. But that's not really the case.\n\nYou will definitely stick out a bit, but to what degree depends on where you live. As a rule of thumb, in urban areas you will stick out less than in rural ones, and in former East Germany you will stick out more than in former West Germany. And sticking out doesn't necessarily mean being looked down upon or being treated rudely. It just means you can't just \"blend in\" easily.\n\nAs for your question, yes, I would recommend Germany. But I'm not black so make sure to check out the experiences of other black people who moved to Germany. There are lots of them on YouTube for example."

Your risk to fall victim to a hate crime in Germany is probably about the same or lower than it is where you are now (assuming you don't live in some perfectly hate crime free utopia right now).\n\nAlso the overall crime rate in Germany is a fraction of what it is in the US (assuming you are American), so even if we take into account that there is added risk for you as a Black person compared to a white person, you would still be safer in Germany than anyone is in the US right now."

The political system is horrible, many Americans have been brainwashed by propaganda so much that they actually believe being in lifelong debt because of healthcare or wanting to get a good education is \"freedom\". Some things like the pledge of allegiance just weird me out, for Americans this seems to be the most normal thing but for me it looks like straight out of a dystopian movie. The two party system is trash, you have two mainly pro free market parties that are both not really different from each other and both would be considered right wing in Europe, yet everyone calls progressive democrats \"communists\" for not wanting to let people die on the streets because they couldn't afford medical treatment. The worst part would be the foreign policies tho, the US has started countless wars and has overthrown countless governments over the last decades and has brought war and misery to a lot of places over the world. They say they want to bring them \"freedom and democracy\", but in reality they just want to exploit their ressources. I know that not every American thinks like crazy Republicans do, so I want to make clear that I have nothing against the American people, but at the same time it's really hard for me to grasp how crazy people like Donald Trump can be elected. For me as a foreigner, stuff like this just proves the stereotypes, and eventhough it obviously is wrong to generalize it still kinda presents all Americans in a bad light, because there must be something fundamentally wrong in a society where people elect a president that says he \"wants to grab women by the pussy\"."

I had to leave in a hurry so my laundries were on my sofa. Came back home, one underwear was lying on the floor right behind the door and the radiator was turned off. I got goosebumps.

Also, offers to help, to get your life back on track, substitute drugs, prevention programs and so on.\n\nUsers were not overly criminalizes, just the dealers.

Specifically, with regards to going to college after high school. \n\nIt‚Äôs kind of hard to explain exactly what my professor was saying.

He also said that ‚Äútrade schools‚Äù are much more common in Germany and implied that less German children go to university when compared to American children. (I put trade schools in quotes cause he called it something else but it sounded likes trade school). He also made it sound like that some German children are not allowed to go to university, even if they want too.\n\nMy above account of what he said might not be totally accurate, but I tried. \n\nSome additional context: I lived in NL and traveled around Europe quite a bit when I was a young child, so I think I have a better understanding of Europe when compared to the average American, but please don‚Äôt assume I‚Äôm an expert by any means.",

    "output": "I might as well weight in. \nAustria and Germany are historically and culturally deeply interwoven states. And I am not talking about moustache man. We go back a long ass time, and that can be felt. \nAs of today, I think Austria is a bit more conservative than Germany, however that is completely my subjective feeling and might be completely wrong. I like that in the EU we are often on the same side and I would say it's a brotherly bond between Germany and Austria. I don't think that Germans are hated there or the other way around and Austria is a great country for trips or ski holidays. \nGenerally speaking, i think that Bavarian people are closer and have obviously more contact to Austrians than Norther Germans, and are thus also culturally much closer to each other. \nFor me personally they are the German speaking buddies from the Alps, where I don't have to sell my liver to get a meal *cough cough* Switzerland *cough cough*. \n\nHope it helps.\n\nEdit: spelling"

She was definitely a bit naive about how dangerous it is to do that in most American cities. She went out once like that, just assuming that a) it was safe and b) that she‚Äôd be able to find a way home from the city center to our house in the country and neither was true. My mom drove an hour and a half just to go pick her up when she found out where she was. So maybe bring something like up with your exchange student."

    "output": "I assume you mean Austauschsch√ºler and not -student, since it is highly uncommon for university students to stay with host families nowadays. Please excuse me if I'm wrong!\nIf you are indeed dealing with a university student, you can disregard all that follows.\n\nThere are quite a few differences between german and US teenagers, and while exchange students do get some cultural orientation there is a big difference between having heard about something and actually understanding it.\n\n\nDrinks with low to medium alcohol content (beer, wine, basically everything that requires no distillation) are legal to consume and buy for 16 year olds. And most will have been drinking occasionally by the time they show up for their exchange year. Their exchange organisation will have told them that they are in for a dry year, but it might be necessary to remind them of that.\n\n\nGerman attitudes to teenagers having sex are in general more relaxed than in the US. Parents basically assume that their kids are getting it on and so prefer it if they do it in a safe enviroment (i.e. at home) and with proper contraceptives. Which means that things like open door policies and so on will seem very strange to your exchange student. If you have such a rule in your house, explain it to them beforehand. They live with you, they are bound by your rules. You just have to explain said rules to them.\n\n\nIn all likelyhood, they won't have a driver's license (not for cars, at least) and even if they have, they probably won't be allowed to drive your car anyway, for insurance reasons. So unless you live somewhere with good public transportation or within easy walking distance from a town centre, they will rely on you for transport. Even more important, since almost everyone else in their class has a driver's license, they might feel a bit isolated at times. They will probably appreciate your moral support here (moral support, you are - just as with your own kids - not required to drive them everywhere).\nWhen I was an exchange student, I walked everywhere, which led to me being stopped by the cops twice, since they thought it suspicious. \n\n\nFor most germans, religion does not play a big role in their lives, even if they nominally belong to a church. I had to explain to my host mother several times that I was, indeed, completely areligious and therefore needed no accomodation to get to \"my church\" on sundays.\n\n\nSchool spirit is not a thing here. They might be pretty bewildered by pep rallies and similar things. I know I was. This is nothing to be worried about, but it might come up in conversation. \nIn general, school is very different in Germany. We don't have sports teams at school (sports are played in sports clubs outside school hours). So if your exchange student is interested in playing a sport, explain to them that their best chance is the school team and help them find out when tryouts are (and you might have to explain tryouts, too).\n\nIn general, german schools don't care what exchange students do during their exchange year. I did a lot of subjects that sounded cool that we didn't have in Germany (like sci-fi literature and geology). While exchange students are supposed to do OK academically, their subject selection is secondary.\n\n\nYour exchange student lives with you to get the full cultural experience, not to be on holiday. So do not hesitate to give them household chores to do (as long as they are within reasonablelimits). They probably have to help at home, too.\n\n\nEdit: something I completely forgot: abbreviations. You guys use a shitton of the things. As do we, but ours are different.\nSo remember to spell out even things that you find totally mundane at least the first time you mention them.\nIt took me forever to get what all the jokes about the DMV were about, simply because I had no clue what the DMV was."

    "output": "1. The obvious thing - Less violence and crime in general: If you don't experience violence or crime often it's not something you'd expect going into a situation. This generally lets you be much more relaxed when dealing with other people.\n\n2. The deeper dive - The political culture is centered around compromise, not domination: The German voting system allows for a more nuanced set of opinions in politics; while the US one inevitably leads to candidates joining one of two teams, if they want to be successful. In a two-party system turning people away from your opponent can be much more effective than winning people for your cause. In the German political system the winning people over part is much more pronounced and due to the need to find coalition partners after an election the attacks on political opponents are more mellow and civilized. In the current federal election campaigns the direct attacks usually confine themselves to things like \"They have this thing in their programme! That's gonna be super expensive!\", not US-style \"The opponent is the literal spawn of satan and if they get voted in the world as we know it will be destroyed!\".\n\n3. The speculation - The US never had to endure being beaten in a war on domestic soil, even temporarily, while this is something that most, if not all, European nations had to endure. That common experience of needing the support of the whole society might just be something that has left a deep imprint on the culture.  \nIn the special case of Germany there's the added tendency to avoid anything nationalistic - if you don't believe that your nation is the best or most important in the world, how could you begin to believe that you are yourself?\n\nAs an aside:\n\n&gt; Obviously the refugee crisis is a very serious topic here right now.\n\nYou're living in the past.

However, there have been numerous occasions in which he would rather go to the store or the agency to get help rather than just calling them. \n\nExamples:\n\n1. Calling a store to see if it has a certain item in stock - he would rather go to the store rather than call first.

I've heard as well the former GDR areas tend to be more culturally conservative, and that the AfD party (which I don't know much about) is most successful in Saxony.\n\nIs what I said true? And could you add your own opinions and experiences on the subject?\n\nThank you for any help!",
    "output": "It depends what you mean by Conservative I guess. I live in the south and people here are traditional and Conservative (family values, go see grandma at the weekend, in a one woman one man marriage etc, a lot go to church on Sundays), but in a lot of ways they are also very open and not reactionary. For example more than half the churches right now have big LGBT flags welcoming queer folks for pride month, and even if a lot of people have traditional values, they absolutely don't force them on others and don't judge you outwardly. I am gay and my husband is brown and we've never had bad experiences or racism here that we've noticed or known about. When I broke down on my bike last weekend in the countryside literally 20 different people stopped to help me out, lent us tools, gave us tips, and were generally super friendly. However in the south in terms of economics, most people are massively in favour of the market economy and capitalism. So mostly the market economy parties like CDU and FDP do well here. Greens also do well but only by moving away from their social tax-and-spend agenda that they have in other states towards more free market policies. \n\nIn Saxony and some of the former East German Bundesl√§nder I don't have experience but it's a bit different. Most people are atheist or non-religious, but there are a lot of social reactionaries who want to ban gay marriage, deport all the migrants, close the borders and ban Islam. They are generally extreme on social issues. They also tend to fracture between some who are massively in favour of market economy and some who want to bring back the old communism days or at least a lot more state intervention in the economy. So here both the Linke post-communist Party and the AFD do very well. In the US you'd call them conservatives too but it's not at all the same mentality.\n\nThen you have the big cities and esp Berlin which are total liberal havens, and I mean Liberal in the true sense. Anything goes. Want to dress as an airplane and pretend to fly around Tempelhof airfield? Hell you can probably find a group who also do that every weekend. Want to date 4 people of different genders at the same time and then hang out in public, no-one will bat an eyelid. Basically anything goes, people are super non-judgemental and you can be punk, hippy, hipster, normcore, whatever you want. Dress as a mermaid if you like. Voting here tends to be for like social-justice and environmental protection. Berlin specifically also has a love-hate relationship with market economies and a lot of people want more heavy regulation. However people in Berlin and other big cities still have that big-city thing of not being very friendly to strangers. I once fell down off my bike in Berlin and injured myself pretty bad, and literally no-one stopped to help me. Some people shouted at me to get out of the bike lane, and then one woman's dog ran up and tried to lick my bleeding wounds, and I pushed it away and the woman screamed at me to be more considerate to her dog."

It just needed some time and willingness to find the funny bone instead of just saying \"Dumb East/ West Germans don't understand humor\"\n\nSo, things like this happen without anybody being at fault. You think something is funny and somebody else doesn't. The only thing to do is to try different styles of humor."

    "output": "As a foreigner in Germany, I would say that it's a pretty good. German society can be difficult to break into, whether it's finding an apartment, making friends or getting a job. Excluding international cities like Berlin or Cologne, there is definitely only one way of doing things: the German way. For a foreigner, it can feel like coming into the system blind.\n\nBut, to Germany's credit, they recognize this and help significantly. There's subsidized language learning in the community adult education schools (Volkshochschules). The foreigner's office (Ausl√§nderbeh√∂rde) might be obnoxious, but it's competent, and the other official offices don't impose any extra barriers on foreigners. There are/were (certain things have been phased out since 2015) programs to help foreigners get extra vocational education or to help them learn a job. From my very limited sense, there are few people that are not part of society (e.g. they're working, in education or in a program to help find work).\n\nOne thing I am critical about Germany is that since many people view there only being one way to do things, \"integration\" is often understood by many Germans to be assimilation. Many Germans want foreigners to speak, dress, eat, think, and breath like a German. I find umbrage to that and personally enjoy displaying my different cultural practices in their faces. But the amount of people with that view are limited. Most Germans I've met are happy to have any foreigners that speak some German, are law-biding and know that Sundays are quiet days."

    "input": "Cracked window in rented appartment, what would you do?. \n\nSo the kitchen window (70cm x 100cm) cracked when the wind was very strong last week.\n\nI told the landlord exactly what happened. He said that it's not his responsibility and I should contact my Haftpflicht / Hausratversicherung to repair the window or do it myself. I did so but my insurance company said that they don't cover rental damages.\n\nI was looking at replacement glasses and they are ~700‚Ç¨ plus labour.\n\nAny advice would be great . Thank you.",
    "output": "Your landlord is wrong. The landlord is resposible to keep the property livable and has to pay for damages caused by external forces, like a storm. Most landlords have a \"Wohngeb√§udeversicherung\" that would pay for most damages to the property. The thing is, you need an extra \"Elementarschutz\" to protect against damages caused by nature, f.e. a storm. If he does not have that extra protection, he has to pay out of his own pocket.\n\nYour own \"Hausratversicherung\" is only paying for damages to your own stuff. The window though is part of the house, so the obligation to pay for the damage should lie with the insurance of your landlord or your landlord directly.\n\nA cracked window is something, that can lead to further damages to the appartment and possibly to your own property. Should the landlord refuse to repair the window you may be entitled to pay less rent, though I would definitely contact a \"Mieterschutzbund\", a tenant protection association. In my experience, they'll can give you advice, even if you're no member. In any case, contact the landlord again and explain, that you are not responsible to pay for a damaged window, if you did not cause the damage."

A lot of times fakefriendly, but way more believable than from southern asian or american cultures. Damn, they celebrated when I was able to say my first sentence in arabic.\n* Cheap prices for me to live on. (But wtf, during that time prices for bottled water on the streets rose from 20cts for me to nearly 2‚Ç¨. That was crazy)\n* All those street vendors.\n* The Cafes. Just chilling there for ours talking with tons of different people while smoking nagilas and drinking really shitty tea and coffee mada from way too many grounds was nice.\n* The different day schedules where nice. I woke up around 7-8 went to work till 3 with an 1 hour nap around 12 below the climate system, then going back home, sleeping till 6-7 going out till 2-3 in the morning and then sleeping till 7-8 again was a nice change of pace.\n* Kairo has the best rooftop bars I was in so far.\n* The streetfood. I think I eat at least 10 tons of dirt while being there, but it was good enough.\n* tourist stuff. My personal highlight was going down the nile for 5 days on a ship.\n\nCons\n\n* The driving. All Mfs there need to be whipped repeatedly. Its just nuts. Nobody follows any rules, people scream at each other and just randomly ram other cars since they dont like them for some reason.\n* Religiosity. Fuck that. The number of times people tried to convert me to save my immortal soul because they liked me was more than for a complete lifetime. And quoting scripture for their decision. Jokes on them, I asked them explicitly what kind of interpratations of texts they follow and read all parts of the quran under those guidelines just to get them to shut up when they were talking bullshit.\n* The hate on jews. Like bruh, they are not the devil incarnate. Yes, the military does shitty things, but not those things your \"credible\" news source tells you. No, I will not help you smuggle bombs into israel when I visit some friends there after my job is done. No, I will not ask them to come over the Kairo. And no, my family is not jewish. Yes, I am sure. No, I also havent been enchanted by a jewish sorceress. No, I am also not being paid off by them to not hate their guts.\n* The inability to get good beer outside of a very few locations in there.\n* The transportation infrastructure.\n\nTbh Egypt is the only country I have been in for longer I would not go a second time. The overall culture clashes and constant pestering over religious things just was too much I did the most known touristy things on the weekends (had completely free Fridays) and a bit more. so there would be nothing really new in this regard."

And how was your experience?",
    "output": "I would not say that it devides children by class but maybe that it reinforces class devides.\n\nOf course you are more likely to get a recommendation for the top branch if your parents can pay for tutoring, if you have a desk, your own room and a quiet environment for studying so richer students are more likely to enter the top branch. Kids without these advantages naturally score worse so that the lowest branch will get more children who share a room and whose parents can maybe not help them with Algebra.\n\nThere are few systems were these things don't influence your performance though.\n\nThe system was originally meant to prepare children for three different types of careers: Lowest branch for craftsmen and manual labour, middle branch for administration and such and top branch for academics.I don't think this is a bad approach and that the pursuit of non academic jobs should be encouraged in children. They offer more to society than anyone in a bank and are much better paid than most people believe. I also I personally find the \"no child left behind policy\" harmfull as it can't adress everybody according to their ability.\n\nAnyways, since nowadays everyone wants into academics, the lower branches become more and more stigmatized and the lowest branch even had do be abolished in places because a degree from there was basically considered worthless. The middle branch is facing a similar fate it seems as more and more people want to go to University for better income and the student life style. Everyone is trying to climb high and those that don't perform or fall are caught in the lower branches of the tree, where perspectives become increasingly dull and people enable each other in bad behavioral patterns.\n\nI went to the upper branch and have to admit that I never really interacted with kids from the lower branches, just like I never really interacted with kids from other schools in general.\n\nI did later on though, when I entered a crafts school and met students from all three branches. I'd say that I could have more or less told you who had gone to what kind of school just after a few minutes of interaction. I think that the differences between students would be more gradual, if the system was different and I think that we need a reform to better prepare students for the future job markets (if there will be any by 2050). The system is not inherently bad but it has met it's expiration date I think. As someone pointed out, General schools are more and more common. They combine all three branches or at least the remaining two."

The friendship is a big symbol in our politics and within our society and sometimes french interests are sacrified for it in some partnerships. We even just use \"friendship\" only for the special relations between Germany and France. Also we tend to see Germany and Germans as the only friendly nation toward us in Europe overall.\n\nHow is it from your point of view ? \n\nI live near the ancient battlefield of Verdun, so personnaly I see the german-french friendship and an eternal peace between us as the most meaningful outcome possible after all the wars waged between our countries and all the lifes lost. I feel like soldiers of the past who went through the horrors of the war would be more than happy to know their descendants are in total peace with their former foes.",

My parents got divorced when I was 7.\n\nMy mother, brothers and I moved to Germany to live there, however, my mom couldn't juggle 3 kids, a job and my dying grandmother at the time. So 2 of us went back to Lebanon to my dad, after a year. I kept visiting every summer until I was 11, then after, I wouldn't see her for almost 10 years and that made me a different person... It made me angry at life.. Why? I don't why... It's my parents'  BS.When we arrived, authorities found out she hold the Lebanese citizenship and annulled her German one.... Accordingly, my middle brother and I lost our German citizenship too but my eldest did not! Why? Because he was born a month before she got it...I appointed a lawyer in Germany to appeal for me but he said you must either apply for a study visa or spouse visa from Lebanon to be able to come live in Germany again.\n\nIt got so bad for me that my mom went to Catholic Organization asking them if they could help us but she told me they shut her down :'(   but that is okay...\n\n# The Lord is my Shepherd.\n\nCan anyone please help me in any way... Honestly guys, I am at the point of breaking down. I have planned my whole life thinking that I was German... I learned 4 languages, I worked as a Translator... a Data Analyst for T√ºV Rheinland Middle East! I graduated university with an A+ on my graduation thesis.. And yet.. I don't know....\n\nForever grateful I shall be, to whomever can just give me some thread of direction to do something...Suicidal thoughts have become a normal daily thought now but that is never ever the way out!\n\nEdit: please forgive me if I am all over the place or forgot something, I am writing this while I am mentally exhausted.  \n\n\nClosure: thank you to each and person who wrote, the pouring of comments to help really helped inspire me to get my C1, you guys have all given me hope... I am thankful honestly and I love you.",
    "output": "You only gain German citizenship at birth when one of your parents is a German citizen at the time of your birth.\n\nYour oldest brother was born before your mother acquired Lebanese citizenship, thus your mother was a German citizen at the time of his birth and he is a German citizen. \n\nWhen your mother become a Lebanese citizen she automatically renounced her German citizenship, since Germany, generally, doesn‚Äôt allow double citizenship. Since your mother wasn‚Äôt a German citizen when you and your middle brother were born, you both aren‚Äôt German citizen.\n\nAs far as I, not a lawyer, can tell, you didn‚Äôt lose your German citizenship, you simply weren‚Äôt a German citizen to begin with.\n\nYour lawyer‚Äôs advice, that you have to apply for a visa to study or work in Germany, seems to be correct.\n\nThe long route of naturalization is probably your only chance to become a German citizen."

    "output": "You realize that you are only asking for the bad stuff, yes? \n\nFine. \n\nNo real bad experiences, just lots of stuff that let me shake my head.\n\nI had American tourists praise me for my spoken English because they couldn't place my accent. They praised me for not having Ze German Accent they know from Hollywood nazis in movies. And surely I must have visited America, how else could my English be so good? Like, they could not fathom that one can learn a language without having any interest or reason to ever visit their country.\n\nI had American tourists being really angry and throwing a tantrum because, yes, they could pay in dollars (which was a very generous store politic in my eyes), but the change would be euros. They kept insisting that they don't want or need euros and they want their change in dollars. They could not understand that while my company was willing to take dollars occasionally from tourists and exchange them at the bank, they did not give me a bunch of American dollars to give out as change. My cash register had euros only, naturally. \nWe also took British pounds and Swiss Franken, never had any issues with Brits or Swiss wanting change in their currency.\n\nI took pity on a lonely American Au pair a few years back, befriended her and invited her and another American new in the country to a day trip to Estonia. Mind you, I said \"Estonia\" and in the days prior I asked them for their pasport numbers, because I needed to buy tickets. They gave me copies of their pasports, I bought the tickets. I went and picked them up early in the morning, we spent a few hours driving to the capital in the country we live in. We boarded the ship, went through pasport control. We crossed the Baltic sea for a good 2 hours, went off the ship, through another pasport control and were in Estonia. \nWe have been in Talinn for 3 hours already before they noticed that the locals spoke another language than where we came from. That was the point when it dawned on me that both of them had no fucking clue that we had left our host country and are now in another country, where people of course spoke another language. It wasn't bad per se, but it blew my mind that they just didn't get it, despite me repeatedly telling them where we are going and that they need pasports etc. Also, how could they not know the general geography of the country they both had been living in for half a year now? That the name of the neighbor country doesn't ring a bell?\n\nThen there were several occasions with American tourists generally embarassing themselves by drinking far more alcohol than they can handle. Yeah, you can drink beer and wine at 16 and everything else at 18, doesn't mean you should. \n\nIn South America I met American tourists that asked me the same idiotic questions American redditors regularly ask here and on r/Germany: if we are all still a bunch of nazis, how we see Hitler, etc. Fucking idiots didn't even realize how insulting they were.  That was really thr most annoying and therefor the \"worst\" encounter I had.\n\nBut, as you can see, all bad personal encounters are mostly bad because of the ignorance and lack of education/understanding that the US is not the center of the world."

    "output": "A small thing, that has a huge impact: Americans seem to lack an \"indoors voice\". They speak super loudly. All the time. Being loud in general and talking over other people's conversations especially is considered to be very rude here.\n\nMost American tourists in Germany/Europe just are so clueless and/or seem to believe that the world genuinely revolves around them.\n\nThe most obvious thing is that many of them seem to believe that our historical town centers are theme parks. They just sit in people's gardens, gawk into windows, walk into churches in the middle of a service or a wedding to sightsee the church, or are amazed that we put down the cobblestone every morning after cleaning up at night (we don't, the cobblestone is the real road). They generally don't seem to understand that the historical centers still are the cores of living cities, with real people living there, not paid actors.\n\nThings that you often see online are super-clueless questions: if Hitler still is the king of Germany, if there is electricity in Germany, if there are cars in Germany. Those are actually not too bad, though; I just imagine everytime that a 6 year old is asking.\n\nSometimes those questions border on the insulting, like one guy once asked here, or maybe over at /r/germany if they should pack a stack of 1$ bills to use as tips in Germany, as servers here surely would be thrilled to receive a real genuine American dollar. That shit's worth something like 85 cents here, and if I wanted an American dollar I could just go to the bank and exchange some currency and also pick up some Swedish or Czech crowns or the much more fun Australian or Canadian dollars while I'm there.\n\nAs I also happen to have a place in Eastern Europe: Americans there are often on probably their worst behaviour. But it's the same stuff that some British and Germans also pull off. Acting like they own the place and rules don't apply to them, urinating on the national freedom monument (that's 90% British guys, though), acting as if every woman was a prostitute (prostitution is illegal there) and generally being huge dicks."

That said, I wasn't in the US since I was a kid (during my elementary years, my family did travel quite a few times to the US though) and had only very limited contact with Americans after that.\n\nThe one I can think off was of an African American (his origin was pretty clear from his English accent). I was commuting to University on a daily basis and there was this group of people travelling on the train. There was a bag that was placed rather idiotically, blocking part of the tight aisle. When the ticket inspector moved the bag away to a safe place where nobody would trip over it, the guy jumped up and started a complete rant about racism that his bag was moved because he was black, instead of his bad and dangerous placement. Also, I highly doubt the ticket inspector was even able to know whos bag it was, he was just following his duty to keep the emergency pathways open and to prevent tripping hazards."

Where a fat old obviously American tourist is already making a scene. As often in Andalusia, the receptionists English isn't very good, but he is trying with hands and feet. \n\nThe tourist wants the poor guy to wash all their clothes while they go out for the day. The Spanish guy is confused and tries to tell them that they don't have washing machines for clients. The tourist proceeds to Google pictures of washing machines (instead of using a translator app..). This goes on for a bit and I get impatient. I offer my help and try to explain in simple English and broken Spanish what the tourist wants. The receptionist gets big eyes..\"We do not offer this service \". The American slaps 50‚Ç¨ on the table \"you do now! Want that 50$? Go and earn them \". The guy tried to explain that he can't leave the reception and start washing and that there is nobody here. But the tourist insists. At a 100‚Ç¨ the guy starts phoning some maids if anybody is up to do it for the money.\n\nMeanwhile the tourist wife also is standing in the door of their room. He points at her to me \"see this is my wife. Don't worry, she was more beautiful when we married, hahaha\". And then starts telling me how he used to be diplomatic staff and isn't used to be treated so shifty. Shows me pictures of the tours they made on their trip, his boat back home in Texas and his house... \n\nEventually he got what he wanted.. But what a prick. If you're so fancy rich, get a luxury hotel next time and don't bother poor students who work part time in a mini hostel..."

    "input": "Can you explain to an American Germany's upcoming elections?. \n\nI'm aware Germany is having an election this fall but beyond that I know nothing. So I have some questions:\n\n- How many elected positions are there going to be on the ballot (federal level only)\n\n- What's at stake(immigration, gas pipelines, nato, russia, middle east, domestic issues) and what different options do the different parties offer?\n\n- This one is googleable but when is the election and is there an \"interim\" period between Merkel leaving and the new person coming in? How long is that period?",
    "output": "&gt; How many elected positions are there going to be on the ballot (federal level only)\n\nThe Federal Diet (Bundestag). Regularly it consists of 598 members, but it's going to be a hell of a lot more due to the details of the voting law.\n\nThe Federal Diet then elects the chancellor. Note that the chancellor is *not* elected by the people. Germany has a parliamentary system, just like e.g. Canada and Britain and most countries in Europe.\n\nNow to get into some details that are super important and very different from the US, so they may be unexpected to you:\n\n* There are six major parties that will almost certainly all be represented in the next Federal Diet.\n* It's almost certain that no party will win a majority of the votes.\n* We have proportional representation, so the six major parties will get a share of the seats in the Federal Diet that corresponds to the share of the votes they get. That's *very* different from having single-member constituencies like in the US (technically we also have single-member constituencies, but they don't play a relevant role; the exact system is complicated).\n* To elect a chancellor, there needs to be a majority in the Federal Diet. No single party will have that, so several (two or three) parties will have to band together to elect a chancellor. That's called a coalition. The chancellor does need the support of all those parties the whole time, because otherwise the Federal Diet could just elect a new chancellor.\n* That means that the policies of the chancellor and their administration are *not* the personal policies of that chancellor, or the of chancellor's party. Instead, they are the combined policies of the coalition.\n* Coalitions usually have a coalition deal that they write down before electing a chancellor, outlining the policies they are planning to implement.\n* Figuring out a coalition and making that deal can take some time.\n* The chancellor is usually the leader/candidate of the strongest coalition party. But until the coalition is hammered out, it may not even be clear who is going to be the chancellor.\n* When they have agreed on a coalition deal, they elect the new chancellor. This is weeks, possibly months after the election. Until then, Merkel stays in office as a caretaker chancellor.\n* The election will be on the 26th of September. It's always on a Sunday, because on Sundays, most people don't have to work.\n\n\n---\n\nEdit: didn't even touch on one of your questions:\n\n&gt; What's at stake(immigration, gas pipelines, nato, russia, middle east, domestic issues) and what different options do the different parties offer?\n\nHonestly, I'd say by far the biggest issue there is is climate change and what we're going to do about it, so cutting back carbon emissions, transforming the entire economy as well as the way we live. Way more important, and more talked about, than any of the issues you mention, probably even more than all of them combined. \n\nBut I think you need an overview of the six parties, from left to right:\n\n* The Left, leftist, as the name suggests.\n* Greens, center-left, environmentalist.\n* SPD, center-left, social-democratic (a term that has lost all its meaning)\n* CDU/CSU, center-right, conservative (Merkel's party)\n* FDP, center-right, liberal (though \"liberal\" in Europe isn't the same as in the US, they're the \"let the market fix it\" party, so like less crazy Libertarians)\n* AfD, far right, complete crazy people that nobody would ever work with\n\nWhen it comes to working together and forming coalitions, all the center-left and center-right parties are in principle open to coalitions with one another. The center-left parties are also open to coalitions with The Left, whereas absolutely nobody would work with AfD. Traditionally, CDU/CSU and SPD are the two big parties that have candidates for chancellor, but this time around, the Greens have joined them in the front row. Polls go up and down like crazy so who knows. CDU/CSU had a huge lead (and has had one for many years), but now it's shrunk down to just a few percentage points of the other two big ones. It looked like a race between CDU/CSU and Greens, but in recent polls, SPD has surpassed the Greens, so nobody can tell how it will end.\n\nOverall, CDU/CSU says the current amount of climate action is enough, FDP says we should work with more market based approaches rather than bans or taxes, SPD is kind of for more climate action, but not really (it's their thing on all issues), Greens want strong climate action, The Left as well, but taking special care that it won't hit the little guy hard. AfD is opposed to acknowledging that there is even an issue to begin with. So that's mostly what's at stake.\n\nSince Germany has been ruled by a conservative led coalition for the last 16 years under Merkel, a CDU/CSU win wouldn't change much. Depending on who they are in a coalition with, maybe some details. More things would change if there were a majority without CDU/CSU, so either SPD+Greens+FDP or SPD+Greens+Left. Especially the latter would mark a major shift to the left, and would bring changes to several aspects of the welfare state, by extending them. A coalition without CDU/CSU might also do things like legalize marijuana.\n\nAs for the topics you brought up:\n\n* immigration: AfD hates immigrants but hopes for an immigration crisis because it would give them votes. The more left leaning a party is, the more it generally supports making things easier for refugees and people in need to come.\n* gas pipelines: AFAIK that ship has sailed. That pipeline is going to be built to completion, even the US has stopped protesting. The Greens are opposed to the pipeline, but it won't have consequences.\n* nato: The Left is in favor of replacing NATO, but the other parties are pretty happy with it, so nothing will change. Though I don't see Germany increasing its defense spending to match the voluntary 2% goal that the NATO has set for 2024.\n* russia: AfD *love* Putin. For some reason, some people in The Left as well (didn't they get the memo that the USSR collapsed?). Greens are pretty strong anti-Putin, anti-Xi, but other parties are largely in favor of keeping a good relationship while pretending to care about human rights\n* middle east: It's a mess, I hope we stay out and strongly oppose the US if they try and start another stupid war there.\n* domestic issues: yes, lots."

Yes, she hasn't had any major fuck-ups or scandals, but that's because she's done *nothing.* We've survived three once-in-a-generation crises, so that's good, but her main contribution there was that she didn't make these problems actively worse.

It may or may not even be indicative of Hamburg as a whole as this is only one experience, so others can back me up if you want.\n\nI'll mostly back up what the other person has said.\n\nLearn German.  This one's a bit weird, because during most interactions in a big city most people will prefer to speak English because their English is probably better than your German.  However, when it comes to making friends, if you only speak English, you will always be a little \"external\" to the group of friends.  Knowing German allows you the potential to be a full deep, close, friend as opposed to a drinking buddy or \"pal\".  That's not necessarily bad depending on what you're looking for.\n\nCompared to America, Germans tend to take friendship more seriously.  They are also very honest.  Initially they may come off cold or even rude, but once they warm up to you and call you a friend, don't expect them to be flaky and don't be flaky in return.  For example, when you are getting to know someone, you may ask to see their place (especially in college, seeing each others dorm rooms is common in America) and they will just say \"no\".  It's fine, you're still friends (or, rather, becoming friends), they just aren't that close yet.  (Also, visiting someone elses home or especially bedroom isn't as common there in general)  I was only there for 6 months, but saw as multiple people opened up more over that time much slower than Americans generally would.\n\nPUT YOUR PHONE DOWN.  I mean this in 2 ways:  Don't expect to have much meaningful conversation or get to know anyone via texting.  They tend to use texting (whatsapp actually) just for practical communication and to set up times to meet in person.  Secondly, when in person, no-one had their phone out.  In my friend groups in America it was not uncommon to be casually hanging out and one or two of the people were texting or doing something of the sort.  That never really happened, and there was more of an expectation that you are always \"there\"."

    "output": "First of all, Germany has no hate speech laws, what we have is incitment to hatred laws. That is a very important distinction.\n\nHate speech laws as the argument in the US circles around them is about unwanted content that might hurt the feelings of poeple. The german law does not care about that. What it cares about is the abuse of speech to dehumanize a part of its population, as this is the first and most essential step to justify harm and violence against them. \n\nSymbols of hate are just banned because of their direct function in this dehumanisation, it is a rally point for dehumanizing ideas to be pushed, you don't have to actually verbalize your dehumanizing ideas when you just can display a sign that does the trick for you to convey this and so much more.\n\n&gt; what if people decided that statues of Hitler, Himmler, etc, are \"historical art\" and wanted them erected in public places...for the purpose of \"preserving history\"? what if they said \"it's heritage, not hate\"?\n\nyeah - no chance with that. Usage of these symbols, as I said, without the proper context conveys the dehumanizing ideals without having to verbalize them."

    "output": "It is important to note that there is no such thing as a hate speech ban in Germany. \nIt is for example legal to say things that would do abolish / do away with our constitution: \"Re-introduce the death penalty\", \"Human dignity is violable\" etc.\n\nHere is the law that you are probably after \"Volksverhetzung ¬ß130 StGB\":\nIt can be illegal to say things that either call for violence against a \"protected class\" (similar to the US, race, religion, ethnicity...) or to \"incite hatred\" against a protected class. Now \"hatred\" in this legal context is different to how the word is used in a day to day context. You might \"hate\" your co-worker or your boss. But thats not what inciting hatred means in this context.  In order to meet this legal defintion you have to be a level above what we would colloquially consider to be hatred.\n\nTo incite hatred the things you communicate must be fitting to send your audience into such a frenzy that they would be so enraged as to commit crimes against the group of people you are inciting hatred towards. This second part which does not explicity call for violence against a group of people is very difficult and I wont pretend to be an expert on it. Because of this difficulty such cases will often land in front of the German Constitutional Court.\n\nI know that this law is stricter than anything the USA has but personally I am cool with it. It is applied reasonably and legally there is no way to misinterpret it in such a way that would actually curb our constitutional right to free speech. I know there are often articles published with headlines like \"Man charged by german Hate-speech laws\" that give the impression that here you have to be really careful not to step on anyones toes. But thats BS, usually when you dig a little deeper you will find that the person charged said something like \"Gas all the K*kes\" or something.\n\nHolocaust denial is also illegal under this law, which I am also okay with. This law also makes a glorification of the Third Reich illegal if it is fitting to infringe on the dignity of its victims. These are both things that I am okay with because fuck Nazis, lmao. \n\nLots of Nazi iconografy is also banned which I am absolutely okay with. \n\nGermany has a historical responibility to recognize and ensure that something like the Holocaust and the Third Reich never happens again. The day that it would be legal in this country to walk through the Brandenburg-Gate with a swastika on your T-shirt yelling \"Heil-Hitler\" is the day I am leaving."

    "output": "I was a \"nerd\" back in the 80s and 90s. Still am. But I never felt that us nerds were so looked down upon as it is often displayed in American media. I made alot of friends with fellow nerds and when I started to do role playing games with some older \"cool kids\" I even became popular amongst the non-nerd \"cool kids\" my age. We also never had that religious craze about stuff like that. There were people who thougt role playing was strange or spending time with games and computers was a waste of time, but nobody ever implied that anything sinister was going on. (Except some JWs, but they don't count, they are batshit insane about anything.) I also never felt that it was a boy thing ruining my chances with women, quite the opposite - almost all my relationships started over one or the other form of gaming and many gaming groups there were several girls as well.\n\nAnother thing that seems very different to me is Anima/Manga culture. I personally never was into it much and most boy nerds I knew weren't either - but a lot of girls were. To this day, I meet grown up women who are kind of surprised that I know about Anima/Manga culture and once they realise they can't stop \"nerding\" about it. So over here, it's actually a girl thing.\n\nI am now 45 years old and very open for example at work about me being a nerd in various ways, and I am surprised how often colleagues you would never expect suddenly start talking about the newest game release they are waiting for or an Anime series that just started on Netflix."

    "input": "Am I the Asshole - from a German‚Äòs point of view. Online purchase gone bad. \n\nSo I have been buying and selling things on platforms like ebay Kleinanzeigen and Vinted for about a year now. I have never gotten bad reviews and have never given bad reviews as well, usually everything is smooth sailing. \n\nHowever, a few weeks ago I had a really bad experience. I bought rain pants (Matschhose) for babies. The quality was described as ‚Äûin einem sehr guten Zustand‚Äú. In my experience buying secondhand things online, usually that means really good. Maybe some pilling here and there and washed colours. \n\nWhen the pants came, the stitches in the crotch area were undone (so there was a hole), the reflectors were scratched and the elastic band was worn out. The colour was also not as expected (the colour part is my fault, more on that later). She also paid for a cheaper sending option than what was agreed on. \n\nI messaged the seller asking her about the colour and sent her a few pictures of the hole, reflectors, and elastic band. I asked her whether it could be that she sent me the wrong set of pants, at this point I didnt think much of it. \n\nShe replied in a really angry tone. She said the colour is correct (she was indeed right, she wrote a note on the bottom saying the colour thing. My bad). However, she didnt talk about the other things I mentioned. Instead she said I should be grateful instead to have received the pants. She also said I could not read properly (reference to the colour). She blocked me directly so that I couldnt reply. \n\nI looked at her reviews from other people, and apparentl this is the 4th time that this happened. I reported her profile and that was it, I forgot about it. \n\nToday she contacted me again, left a bad review on my profile. Again continued to say I cant read and that she was in the right. At this point I found her very insulting. I reported her the second time and replied to her comment. I wrote please look at this person‚Äòs older reviews. I am not the first victim. And I thought it would end. \n\nShe actually replied to my reply and said ‚Äûdu bist doch nicht mehr ganz with a laughing emoji‚Äú. At this point I stopped replying and let go since it was getting a bit too childish. \n\nHowever, very curious. Did i miss something and might be the asshole? Any cultural faux pas?",
    "output": "Absolutely no cultural faux pas. She sent you pants which clearly no longer fit their purpose. What good are rain pants for children if they have a hole in it that the water can pass through?\n\nWhat she should have done is apologize and return your money.

    "output": "Honestly, answering this honestly would end up in something that would approach \"epic rant\" and \"beatdown\" territory, so I am afraid there will be lots of answers that you won't like.   \n\n\nFor languages, there's the saying \"divided by a common language\" when speaking about all the small differences that can make no sense in trying to understand each other - and the same is very much true culturally for the US and many of the western countries.   \n\n\nDue to how the western world developed in the last 70 or so years, exposure to US culture and media has been much greater in Europe than the other way around, which leads to a very noticeable gap in understanding from the US side to the European side - this, coupled with the US being very big on Nationalism / Exceptionalism as well as what I only can call Indoctrination starting from a very young age leads to a lot of things that you consider normal, and we consider disgusting or at least very, very wrong.   \n\n\nI'll still try to use this writing prompt to write up some of my thoughts, even though they might very well be a caricature at this point, as they've been repeated over and over...   \n\n\nLet's take the simple notion that many people in your country, even those that would benefit the most, fight tooth and nail about getting universal healthcare and a social security net for everyone - it has been so ingrained into you as a society that everyone needs to look only after themselves and that somehow trying to act as a bigger community is something bad (\"communism\" in american-speak) is baffling to almost all of us.   \n\n\nThe same about your gun culture - while I agree that gun ownership in itself is not something bad, the sheer ease how to obtain guns and the willingness to use them in a very unsafe / idiotic matter is baffling to us. There is just not enough regulations and requirements about gun ownership regarding safety and handling.   \n\n\nIn addition to that, your school system, or rather, the everyday execution of it. While I really like and look at your system of after-school activities and clubs with envy, even the notion that you need armed Guards (or Guards in general) at a school, much less stuff like Metal Detectors at the entrances is just something that makes me weep internally.   \nAlso, the pledge of allegiance - this is something that most people would expect \"maybe\" in North Korea, but the extremes in which this is practiced in the US is outright creepy to us (approaching 3rd Reich level creepiness).  \n\n\nNext up, your whole service industry - many Americans I have interacted with or accompanied have mentioned how rude they consider our serving staff in Restaurants, Bars etc. - and were then baffled when I told them that for me, the opposite is true, and I consider most Servers in the US rude to the extreme.   \n\n\nIn Germany, we have never implemented a tipping culture even approaching the US (instead, we follow the initial idea of a tip being a gratification for going above and beyond) - this, combined with the fact that German restaurants make a lot of their income on drinks (this is why we also don't do the free refills thing), our dining experience is substantially different than yours:  \nIn the US, constantly getting interrupted by the server (often even mid-sentence while talking with someone) to show presence, get you to order more stuff, or gtfo - to increase rotation on their tables and therefore tipping - is so rude to a German you can't really grasp it if you never went outside of that bubble.   \n\n\nOver here, it is not uncommon to go to a Restaurant, eat your meal, and then still sit there drinking and chatting for hours - and the restaurants are fine with it, because again, most of their money is made on drinks. This is also why our Servers are usually discreet and in the background, and only check on you once in a while, expecting you to signal for them to come over if you need anything - it makes for a much more relaxed and private experience.   \n\n\nSpeaking of service culture, one thing most people will mention right away is the unwritten rules around \"fake politeness\" (\"Hey, how's it going\") and (\"Hey we should totally hang out sometime\") - this just doesn't work for a German mentality.   \n\n\nThen, obviously, we consider the whole \"no ID\" / \"Drivers License for everything\" strange, as we have a central register of all citizens and a national ID card for everyone (and their address / social data etc. on file) - this also means that the whole concept of \"registering to vote\" is nonexistent here, as every eligible citizen is automatically registered and mailed their voting documents by the government without doing anything about it. We also vote on Sundays, to maximize the amount of people that can go voting - and our political system is also set up to encourage diversity much more, and can't be as easily manipulated in excluding voters (e.g. Gerrymandering in the US).   \n\n\nCar-Culture and the whole culture around driving is completely different as well, as is the level of drivers ed. in both countries - we sometimes joke that getting a drivers license in the US is so easy you could just as well hand it out as the toy in a cornflakes box...   \n\n\nSame goes for the culture around drugs and alcohol, as Germany has much different (much more relaxed) rules about what you would consider underage drinking.   \n\n\nThen, of course, are your homes. I agree that many Americans live in houses that are much bigger and better equipped than German ones - which is easy if you have space aplenty and cheap materials - but am shocked when I see that a house that is barely 20 years old basically can fall apart from wood rot and other issues depending on area.   \n\n\nIn Germany, most construction is based around stone, concrete, or other durable materials, and wood for outer walls is not something you commonly see - this is also why I was thoroughly confused about the \"This is the Binford 6000 Chainsaw - guaranteed to tear down through every wall\" commercial on \"Home Improvement\" back in the day when I was younger , as the house I was living in was built from solid brick with some steel thrown in for good measure... to give you an example, the house I'm living in has been built in 2004, and it is only now considered \"settled\" in the sense that the building has come to rest against the ground - it is basically considered a new construction at this point, and the only thing it ever needed done to it (right now) is fixing some holes in the plaster due to hail and painting it...   \n\n\nThis leads me to the next thing - the concept of owning multiple houses and \"trading up\".   \nIn Germany, decent houses cost much more money than in the US, and at the same time, the process of buying and selling a house is much more complicated and expensive - expect 10-15% on top of the purchase price in legal fees and taxes alone. We also have penalties if you sell a house less than 10 years after buying it (iirc).   \n\n\nMost people in Germany rent (as our tenant protection laws are lightyears better than in the US, this is much more feasible), and if they buy a house, that is a once in a lifetime decision and you expect to live in that place until you die (and to inherit it to your offspring).   \n\n\nBut, besides these bigger and more generic things, there's the obvious differences in the everyday: The metric system not being used, the weird date format you guys use, the stunning prevalence of SMS in the form of iMessage / the dominance of iPhones with people..   \n\n\nI think I could continue this for another hour or so but I think this wall of text should be a start :)"

My parents were \"intelligencia\" (engineer and medical doctor, respectively), so for them the change was kind of good, they thought. Then my dad lost his job at the people's brown coal combine, so he started looking for some of the supposedly well-paid jobs for engineers in West Germany. It was very hard to find a high ranking job in Western Germany when you were north of age 40, with a Saxon accent, all your references littered with Socialist symbolism and weird Socialist titles, and no stylish clothing or a cool car... \n\nMy grandparents just started their pension time around this time. All of their life's work was summarized as \"low-paying job, potentially member of terrorist organization\". So they got a laughably small pension to live on, all the stuff they bought over the past 40 years went worthless within days, and all the new stuff was really expensive. And we were the lucky ones, with an owned house and a large garden. Just imagine the same thing for the people in cramped shitty appartments in some city that gets depopulated over night. \n\nOf course a lot of people were cranky. I understand them completely. Just for me, personally, the whole system change was paradise."

But I just had a baby with my boyfriend who is from Germany, and we agreed it would be a good idea for him to speak mostly German to the baby so she grows up bilingual. Honestly though, this would have happened anyways even if we hadn't agreed to it because German is his first language and it just comes naturally when speaking to the baby. Which is awesome! \n\nAnyways, he had always called me schatzi and everyone in his whole family calls each other schatzi, and so now obviously he is calling the baby schatzi. But he calls her schatzi maus and it is just the cutest thing. Watching him become a father and being so sweet with her is one of the best things I've ever experienced. So I was thinking of getting a little tattoo of the word schatzi and then a little drawing of a mouse next to it, to commemorate this feeling. To me, a non German speaker, I love the idea. Obviously a significant word in another language is always going to be a little more meaningful to the foreigner, because it is not used on the day-to-day. But I wanted to check with Germans that this wasn't totally weird? If I saw a German with the English word \"baby\" or \"darling\" or \"treasure\" included in a tattoo to commemorate their child, I would not think it was weird at all, but who knows.",

If someone with a turkish, albanian, aserbaidschani, etc. background or roots in a community like that I woulnd't bat an eye if they name their kid Zafar.\n\nIts getting better, but I'd say at least the next years you can expect some kind of discrimination in regards to jobs or finding flats with an non-german name and probably for the next 20-30 years at least for a really unusual non-german names. I would definitely count Tawfik and Khadem as especially unusual.\n\nEveryone who tells you its gonna be fine and theres absolutely no problem is not accepting reality for what it unfortunately is."

If they are names from a language that doesn't use the Latin alphabet, it would make a lot of sense to use a German based transliteration rather than an English based one. Amir is much better than Ameer, because people know how to pronounce it. Any name that ends in -fik will get the kid bullied as a teenager (Fick = fuck).\n\nIn general, most foreign names are restricted to immigrant communities. Giving your child a German name really helps with integration because they will automatically come off as a lot less \"foreign\" that way. I once knew a guy named Rainer whose two parents were both Chinese and had just moved to Germany when he was born. I immediately thought of him as \"German, probably with an Asian background\". If he had been named Zhaomin or something like that, I would have probably thought of him as \"Chinese German\" or \"well integrated Chinese\" without thinking about it.

    "output": "Bread is simply the most important food item in Germany. We have it for nearly every meal, often as the main component. Many people will have bread five times a day. So it has to be good and healthy, otherwise we couldn‚Äôt live the way we do.\n\nIt‚Äôs really just a cultural thing. If a village is barely large enough to have *one* shop, that shop is going to be a bakery, because people need their fresh bread. Buying prepackaged bread from the supermarket is possible, but uncommon. The quality is also lower since it isn‚Äôt fresh. And of course there is the legal requirement that every bakery has to have a master baker. Usually the owner. Becoming a master baker requires years of both school and learning on the job, and you have to prove your skills in an examination. My sister just became a master baker herself, after years of leaning (it‚Äôs three steps: apprentice, journeyman, master).\n\nOf course good ingredients matter. And of course there are bakeries that have kept ‚Äútheir‚Äù sourdough alive for generations, because its combination of cultures and its flavor is just particularly good. Of course you need to give each dough its time, have it at the right temperature, etc. \n\nBut what it really comes down to is culture. Bread is just very important to us, and bread quality matters. If people have the choice between bad cheap bread and tasty but more expensive bread, many will spend the money for the higher quality.\n\nI think the cultural importance is different even in other European countries. Essentially, a Frenchman will have cheese with bread whereas a German will have bread with cheese."

    "output": "It should be noted that, for the most part, the whole issue needs to be understood as mostly banter.\n\nBavaria has a pretty strong cultural identity that diverges from what other Germans view as German. This has historical reasons, but it's also safe to say that Bavarians aren't the only people in Germany with a distinct culture. It just gets the most attention.\n\nI think the reason Bavaria gets so much attention is because 1) Bavarians are often very outspoken about their pride in their heritage and traditions and 2) because the CSU, a regionally bespoke version of the conservative CDU party, is quite clear about who they represent on a national level. Bavaria is also seen as quite conservative due to strong cultural ties to catholicism and its habit of voting for the aforementioned CSU.\n\nIn addition, Bavaria has become synonymous with German culture through American media. This is frustrating for other Germans who, as I mentioned, aren't very much like the Bavarians and don't enjoy being stereotyped as such. Yes, Bavarian culture is German culture, but not all German culture is Bavarian culture. Honestly, Bavarian culture isn't even the only culture in the state of Bavaria either, considering the presence of Swabians and Franconians to name a few.\n\nSo, TL;DR, Bavaria is essentially German Texas.\n\nNow, I've lived both in Bavaria and outside of it. I haven't observed any substantial desire in Bavaria to separate from the rest of Germany. Regional/local \"patriotism\" isn't at all limited to Bavaria either. A good amount of other states have their own weird cultural quirks. Bavaria isn't as different from the rest as it's often made out to be.\n\nThe ranty bit: I have to admit, I'm sometimes frustrated by people who say they know exactly what Bavarians want and think. I find that a bit presumptuous. Banter and stereotypes are fine to an extent, but they're not something I believe you should treat as facts.\n\nIf Bavarian culture isn't German, then neither is Swabian, Saxonian or Berliner culture either. K√∂lner Karneval isn't German culture, it's from Cologne! I hope it's clear what I'm trying to point out here.\n\nI wish we could all just enjoy the various regional cultures because that diversity is what makes Germany so interesting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[Wow, this is a lot longer than I thought it would get\\]"

What are the specific cultural aspects that you think contribute to this success? The stuff you do in your personal or social life? Ideas you truly believe etc.",
    "output": "The first I can think of, which sets Germany apart from GB or France is probably decentralization.\n\nGermany was made up of many small or medium states that developed their industry independently from one another. Industrialization also benefited from the availability of waterways and German states being among the earliest adapters of an education for all mentality which made Germany a leader in many sciences at the beginning of the 20th century. All that gave Germany quite the head start and the decentralization aspect remains in the federal states. In much the same way that Germany benefited from being made up of several small to medium sized states, the economy today benefits of it's many small to medium sized companies that are market leaders in their respective niche fields. Iirc Germany has more \"Hidden Champions\" than the next few countries combined. These small companies are often owned by the founders or their heirs and invest in long term success rather than short term growth.\n\nA strong social system, protection of workers rights, paired with a strong work ethic and the central position within Euope also play a role.\n\nI'm hesitent to mention the Prussian virtues but reliability and a certain amount of pragmatism probably also play a role.\n\nWhen answering this question people also point out the education system that doesn't push academics at all costs but favours specialized apprenticeships and schooling in partnership with the companies. This is changing though.\n\nIn short, Germany had a good start and was able to stay ahead by fortunate circumstances and a pretty diverse economy that is not dependent on one single branch of industry."

We complain a lot, never content, nothing can ever be good enough, which drives us to make the best version worldwide of most things we make.\n\nPublic solidarity well balanced with personal responsibility. We're not the US, but we're also not France, we're somewhere in between.\n\nLast but not least our Prussian legacy:  A strong, well organized public administration and full acceptance of the rule of law. Corruption almost exclusively exists in the upper echelons of politics and is rarely if ever as explicit as a clear quid pro quo, more like \"let's not piss them off, we might still need them later\". I personally have never experienced corruption nor do I know anyone who has. Bribes are so rare that I can't even imagine being asked to pay one or getting paid one, it's a foreign concept I only know from TV and movies.

    "output": "&gt;There were talks from new German gov that they see Federal Europe as the goal.\n\nThis is nothing new. The European unification is a longterm-goal established in our constitution.\n\n&gt;Or is the power associated with being the largest country in EU federation the main factor attractive for Germany?\n\n75% of the perceived German dominance in the EU is a myth made up by Brexiteer propaganda. The EU has 27 members, and each of them, including states like Luxembourg or Malta, has veto power. Germany has 96 out of 705 seats in the parliament, and \\~20 of them are useless to us because they are usually held by isolated parties.\n\nThe German influence that goes beyond the share that matchs our size mostly comes from our political continuity and position. For example, we've had three different chancellors since 1982. In contrast, during this time, Italy had about 20 different prime ministers. We have nine neighbor countries, we are geographically and culturally close to almost every other EU country and we have politicians who were socialized on both sides of the iron curtain. This, of course, makes networking much easier than it is for a country like the UK or Italy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think another important point why the EU is regarded more positively in Germany than in other countries is because we have a 1000 years old federal tradition. People in France are used to a centralized state that holds the vast majority of political power, so of course it's inherently suspicious to them that power is given to another entity where other peoples have a say as well. Meanwhile, Germany itself has always been a microcosm of a united Europe, and the EU is just another, higher instance to what we're already used to.\n\nI personally consider myself as pro-European as it gets. I believe the EU is the best thing that ever happened to this continent, and the way we're working together to overcome the current crisis confirms its potential. But I'd like a united Europe to succeed, and I currently don't see a realistic pathway to a stable state-like union. We have more urgent issues."

There are few special schools designed for highly gifted children.\n\nWhat might be the reason for this state of affairs? Is there something I do not see in the German education system?

That murder is claimed to be the reason he fled to Amsterdam, and the reason why my family is in NL. \n\nThe document is not official, but supposedly written by his grandson, who never met him.

And then step 2: can I find out more about this murder? \n\nAre there some Historians who can help me where to start, are there some good search engines for (local) archives in Germany?",
    "output": "Birth certificates as we know them today didn‚Äôt exist back then, births, deaths and marriages were registered by your local parish church. Seeing as your ancestor lived in 17th century Sachsen-Anhalt he likely was Protestant, so if you know where and when he was born you might try and look up all you can find about him on archion.de. This is a site where the various Protestant churches of Germany have uploaded their parish registers to, so you might be in luck there. Fair warning though, the site isn‚Äôt free to use and you‚Äôll be seeing just the scans and not the transcriptions, so you might need to learn how to read Kurrent (the handwriting used in Germany back then) before.\n\nRegarding the murder: such a case would likely have led to a court trial, and maybe additional information might also be found in the servant‚Äòs death entry in the local church register. If you‚Äôre lucky, the court documents have survived centuries of archival storage and a bunch of wars. You could try and write to the Landesarchiv of Sachsen-Anhalt (poststelle@la.sachsen-anhalt.de) and ask them for pointers on where to look. Make sure to give them all the info you have, and don‚Äôt rely too much on them finding anything though - 350 years is a long time after all.\n\nAll the best on your research!"

This irritates most non-Bavarian Germans a little, as there is *so* much more to German culture than just Bavaria. It would be a bit like a foreigner thinking that all of the US was like Texas. \n\nAdditionally, while most German regions have a distinct culture and a certain sense of self-identity, that sense is particularly strong in Bavaria. Not quite on the \"we would rather secede and become our own country\" scale, but they still feel like they're in some way \"special\". This isn't helped by the CSU party (the \"sister\" party to the national CDU, the Christian Democrats, Angela Merkel's party), which operates solely in Bavaria, has won pretty much every state election there since WW2, and has a distinct sense of \"Bavaria is special\" in its politics."

Eating in the restaurant or eating ice cream is incredibly cheap by West German standards. \n\nThen my parents try to buy an instrument, just to get rid of the money before we go home again. This goes on all the time, but almost everything in the shops windows can't be bought, it has to be ordered, or things that are available in West Germany simply don't exist. \n\nAnd so we drive home again with over 200 Ostmarks."

Der Grund, warum ich es frage, ist, weil ich das Gef√ºhl hatte, dass in L√§ndern wie eurem, die eine h√∂here Breite auf Erden haben, w√§hrend des Winters es Schnee st√§ndig f√§llt und darum sieht man die Stadt w√§hrend dieser Jahreszeit vollkommen mit Schnee bedeckt.

    "output": "They are the same, but some forms tend to be more common among Jewish / Christian Germans.\n\nJews weren't allowed to own land and to become craftsmen until 19th century, so Jews tend not to have names based on these professions (like M√ºller, Meier, Bauer, Schneider, Schmidt). That's why some Jews became traders, bankers, jewellers (that's where names like Edelstein, Einstein, Joel come from).\n\nMany, especially poorer Jews who couldn't find work in these jobs converted to Christianity and got assimilated. That means you basically had to \"afford\" being a Jew, and as a result, those who were recognizable as Jews tended to be wealthier, when in fact most Christians were ethnically (at least to some degree) Jewish. This is on the one hand where prejudices came from and why they are so insane. But it also means basically all German Jewish family (and first) names are somewhat common for German families as well.\n\nGerman names based on regions (Preu√ü, Sachs, Bayer, ...) are also common for both Jewish and other Germans (e.g. Anne Frank)."

You could be sitting in public transport minding your own business and the person next to you will start complaining or talking about politics or general shenanigans etc. This is just the norm here and it's considered rude/weird and anti social if you don't at least engage that person with a nod or a few words. It's understandable since life here is difficult and everyone's stressed plus people here are just more social on average :)\n\nNow I'm considered anti social where I'm from, because I do not like talking to strangers and I don't do small talk. It's not personal, it's just that I like to think when I'm in public and organize things I need to do in my head and focus on why I'm out and about - unless it's for leisure time and I'm in a good mood - also I don't enjoy being asked how I'm doing, because ppl where I'm from will expect you to just say \"yeah I'm fine\" or sth along those lines when I interpret this quite literally and say either good or bad honestly. \n\nI read a lot about the norms in Germany and I'm wondering, I'm a bit social awkward. Idk how that will affect me? I'm going to an international city - Frankfurt - so I'm assuming I'll meet people there from different cultures so maybe I need to be more social than expected in other German cities? I'm also wondering if just looking a bit aloof/awkward in general will affect my social standing?\n\nMost things I've read about socializing in Germany don't seem too bad to me however, the one thing that will probably make me uncomfortable is the staring. Where I'm from, people will eye you up and down and look you in the eyes for a little longer than usual (this can be hostile or just curiosity depending on the person) and this always creeped me out a bit. Do I have to look people in the eye consistently while speaking to them? Will it be considered rude if I don't? (it's really weird to me tbh but I'll get over it if it's respectful to do so).\n\nI'm worried I won't be able to make friends or will come off as a weirdo, so any tips are welcome(yes I read the stuff on the r/Germany sidebar).

    "input": "Will my social skills affect my life in Germany?. \n\nSo I come from a country in northern Africa, where people are extremely social. You could be sitting in public transport minding your own business and the person next to you will start complaining or talking about politics or general shenanigans etc. This is just the norm here and it's considered rude/weird and anti social if you don't at least engage that person with a nod or a few words. It's understandable since life here is difficult and everyone's stressed plus people here are just more social on average :)\n\nNow I'm considered anti social where I'm from, because I do not like talking to strangers and I don't do small talk. It's not personal, it's just that I like to think when I'm in public and organize things I need to do in my head and focus on why I'm out and about - unless it's for leisure time and I'm in a good mood - also I don't enjoy being asked how I'm doing, because ppl where I'm from will expect you to just say \"yeah I'm fine\" or sth along those lines when I interpret this quite literally and say either good or bad honestly. \n\nI read a lot about the norms in Germany and I'm wondering, I'm a bit social awkward. Idk how that will affect me? I'm going to an international city - Frankfurt - so I'm assuming I'll meet people there from different cultures so maybe I need to be more social than expected in other German cities? I'm also wondering if just looking a bit aloof/awkward in general will affect my social standing?\n\nMost things I've read about socializing in Germany don't seem too bad to me however, the one thing that will probably make me uncomfortable is the staring. Where I'm from, people will eye you up and down and look you in the eyes for a little longer than usual (this can be hostile or just curiosity depending on the person) and this always creeped me out a bit. Do I have to look people in the eye consistently while speaking to them? Will it be considered rude if I don't? (it's really weird to me tbh but I'll get over it if it's respectful to do so).\n\nI'm worried I won't be able to make friends or will come off as a weirdo, so any tips are welcome(yes I read the stuff on the r/Germany sidebar). I really want to integrate as much as possible and not be odd.",

I consider myself a pragmatic pacifist, meaning while I don't want war and I don't consider it a valid method of diplomacy to archive state goals, I know that many regimes around the world consider war a very valid or even preferable method to get what they want. The only way to ensure peace in this kind of world is having a military that makes it unfeasible to rely on war.\n\nAt the moment, we rely on others to have this kind of military and security, but I hope personally for an defensive EU army, and in that, Germany has to provide a core as the largest an richest nation in the union. We have to step up so that we can be with France the core of it."

This is important, because you need a Meldeadresse (registration address), because only then the local job center can confirm the responsibility for you.Let's say your friends allow you to stay with them for a certain period of time. Then you go to the registration office. After registering, you go to the bank and open an account. Then you go to the job center (or do it online...) and apply for ALG II. Since you live with your friends, you need the list of the costs of the rent, so that the Jobcenter pays for you your share of the rent.\n\nAt the same time you register Mittellosigkeit or \"indigence\". This way the Jobcenter knows that you are completely broke. You should then provide bank statements from your German and US bank. Then it is more likely that you will get an advance partial payment so that you can buy something to eat.Once the application is approved, you can start looking for your own apartment. Once you have found a suitable apartment, you go back to the job center and apply for the costs of housing plus the 3-month rent, which must be deposited as security for rent in a separate account. In addition, you apply for Erstausstattung (initial equipment) for the apartment. Then you get sum X for furniture. Carpets, appliances (washing machine, television), etc.\n\nAt the same time, be prepared for the Job Center to require you to take German courses. The costs will be covered by the Jobcenter."

For example, the price of bread in my country is the most expensive in the world. Well, our breads are more expensive than Switzerland or Luxembourg! Hell, Who would believe that bagels and baguettes have become so luxurious?! (Even I am not sure of our breads will taste better than European ones). The prices of our sweets, meats, fruits, vegetables, eggs, cheese, milk and all kinds of dairy products are insane. Tourists/migrants/residents from our neighboring country, Japan, were also terrified when they saw our supermarket prices. How the hell can Germany keep grocery prices fair?",
    "output": "Many food staples are produced cheaply in other countries with lower wages. Potatoes from Egypt, bell peppers and strawberries from Spain, courgettes and broccoli from Italy, cherries from Turkey, watermelons from Morocco, etc. This list is very very long. So basically we pay less than we would if all these things were grown in Germany. \n\nThe EU means that there are no import tariffs on foods produced in other EU countries. Similar goes for countries who have an associates treaty with the EU: Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia, etc.  Again, this drives down prices. \n\nDue to Germany's central location in Europe, transportation to and from Germany is cheap. \n\nThen there is the fact that Germans aren't as picky about the quality of their fresh veggies as Italians, French or Spaniards. If it cannot be sold in Italy or France bc the quality is less than ideal, it gets send to Germany. We Germans will eat it, pay lower prices and be smug at the French when they call us \"trash eaters\" bc we paid less than them. \n\nGermany is the EU's most populous country by a wide margin. 84 million people vs 65 million in France. This gives German supermarket chains considerable buying power and thus negotiation power with farmers collectives. Add in that German supermarket chains like Kaufland and Aldi are not only in Germany, but also in many Eastern European countries as well. \n\nCompare that to South Korea: Your country is cut-off from other countries from cheap and fast transport by rail or road. Importing fresh veggies from China involves shipping them either through North Korea or loading them on a boat. This drives up prices. \n\nMaking an educated guess, your politicians also have an interest in keeping South Korea mostly self-sufficient when it comes to food production. (Something to do with your brothers to the north and the political situation you are in.) Your politicians want to protect local farmers. So they probably also have import tariffs on food from outside South Korea."

Bavarians are Bavarians, other Germans are Germans, too.\n\nIn short, between 1871 and 1945, Germany was dominated by Prussia. Germany had different states, but Prussia, one single state, had more than half of the population and more than half of the land area. Until 1918, the Prussian king was also at the same time the German emperor, and usually the Prussian prime minister was the German chancellor. For this reason, people within Prussia often didn't even think a lot about the distinction.\n\nBavaria was the second largest state, with its own king and its own \"national pride\", essentially. And while Bavarians felt German, they definitely didn't identify with Prussia, which is why there has always been a difficult relationship with the German central state.\n\nAfter 1945, Prussia was dissolved and new states were created, but except for Bavaria, all modern German states have at least a tiny bit of what used to be Prussia in them."

    "output": "A bit of history concerning Eurovision:\n\nGermans never really cared about Eurovision.\n\nI know that the general opinion was:\n\"People don't like Germany because of the war.\nThis is why we never get any points. It's really politics and about neighbours giving each other points. But people still hate us and this is why \nour neighbours Switzerland and Austria don't give us any points and why French songs are always winning!\"\n\nEurovision had its brief moment in the 70s when there was a lot of German Schlager music and when we also sent some fancy acts such as Dschingis Khan with Moskau (which apparently has become a meme in the recent years). But we didn't perform well with our fancy and colourful 70s acts.\nPeople still didn't care that much about it.\nAs far as I know people didn't even really watch it.\nThe general opinion was that even if we're trying and even if we put in some effort we'll never win it.\n\nThings changed after our first win in 1982 with \"Ein bisschen Frieden\". There were jokes that it takes an anti-war song in order for Germany to win.\nBut people didn't really care that much after our first win.\nThey still had the rule that every contestant had to perform in their native language and \"German Schlager\" has lost its popularity. It wasn't popular with younger people.\n\"German Schlager\" was considered old people music and people thought it was cringe.\n\n\nI grew up in the 90s and I can guarantee you that people thought of Eurovision as dated and conservative and stuck in the 70s. It was seen as this boring old people show with German Schlager music for old conservative people. Nobody really watched it.\n\nTHEN there was young comedian/entertainer Stefan Raab who was popular with the young kids.\nHe made a lot of fun of \"German Schlager\" and \"Volksmusik\" and made parody songs.\nHe showed some clips of Eurovision in his show making fun of contestants and songs because it was so  backwards and cringe. He introduced Eurovision to a younger audience who didn't really know about it.\n\n\nHe then wrote a parody song with deliberately bad and cheesy lyrics making fun of German Schlager and he sent a guy acting weird in a tacky 70s outfit (think Austin Powers) to make fun of the fact that Eurovision was somehow stuck in the 70s.\nThis was in 1998 with Guildo Horn and the song \"Guildo hat euch lieb!\". It was a memorable performance and it stood out and was considered weird at the time back when camp or deliberately cheesy performances weren't common in Eurovision. \nStefan Raab basically trolled Eurovision in 1998.\nPeople enjoyed watching it.\nAnd we were in the top 10 after a long time which was celebrated accordingly.\n\nIn 2000 Stefan Raab had an even bigger late night show.\nHe was very popular with younger people and he decided to troll Eurovision once again.\nNow he wanted to perform himself. \nHe wrote a song with basically meaningless lyrics in heavy dialect and dressed up like a guy from the 70s and had a performance with a glowing guitar and lights and girls in long robes taking them off to reveal shorter dresses. Lots of gold and glitter.\nOnce again it was making fun of 70s cringe.\n\nKeep in mind that Eurovision was really dusty and backwards and took itself really seriously back then.\nThese kinds of performances stood out and were considered \"weird\" and got a lot of attention and criticism.\nWe ended up in the Top 10 again.\n\n\nNow after a few years in 2004 Stefan Raab was celebrated so much for his comedy trolling performances because Germany never got this far that he actually tried to take it seriously.\n\nThere was a casting call and a little contest (because casting shows and idol shows were popular at the time). \nOur real casting shows/idol shows were very superficial and cheesy and he took a different road focusing on voice only which resulted in a young dude with a great voice but looks that weren't your standard male pop idol back then.\nStefan Raab wrote a song and Max Mutzke with \"Can't wait until tonight\" became 8th place in Eurovision.\nA huge win for German standards.\n\nNow Eurovision changed. There were Lordi and other fancier and more daring performances.\nIt wasn't the stuck up boring old people show that Raab made fun of anymore.\n\nStefan Raab decided to really take it seriously once again with another casting call and another show that was like an idol show but focused on quality and not on scandals.\nThe winner was Lena and he wrote her a song.\nThe rest is history.\nWe won in 2010 with Lena and \"Satellite\".\n\nStefan Raab is responsible for most of Germany's success in Eurovision.\n\nAfter his victory he didn't care about it anymore.\nIt was as if he finished what he jokingly proclaimed in 1998: That he wanted to win Eurovision.\nKeep in mind he's a comedian with a late night show.\nHe invented regional German variants of Eurovision \nthat were quite popular. \n\nPeople lost interest in Eurovision again.\n\nStefan Raab retired in 2015.\n\n\nAnd now you have the same old people TV stations making boring decisions and being stuck in some decades ago. Not caring about young people's taste (Electric Callboy) and randomly choosing people."

    "output": "Yes, it is deep in our society and if you think about it there is some logic to it. Kids navigate traffic on their own. First graders, so kids as young as 6, often  go to school by themselves, they go to visit friends, they go to the local ice-cream parlor to buy some ice cream or just ride their bikes in the  neighborhood. \n\nJaywalking is considered putting those kids at risk by setting a bad example they might copy. So, even if there is not a kid directly next yo you, watching intently as you cross the red light, you never know if there isn't a kid 10 metres behind you or to your right, paying attention. So the need to not set a bad example by jaywalking is rooted among many Germans and they will tell you off for it, especially if there actually are kids close by."

    "output": "I don't know too much about all the visa issues but if you have a job lined up in the field you studied int university that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nNow to the part I do want to talk about: Your kids.\n\nChildren pick up the language faster than adults. For your six year old it shouldn't be a problem whatsoever. First grade in Germany has very little content and is more about learning the social structure of school and the very basics of writing and counting.\nThe alphabet and numbers 1-100 are easy for most kids to learn. It will be a good time to get to know the language for your kid. Teachers here are used to children of immigrant workers that don't know the language. You might even qualify for subsidized private language tutoring for your kids.\n\nNow for you 9 year old it's already a bit more difficult. He would probably attend 3rd grade here. In third grade there is a big focus on reading. But even then I wouldn't worry too much about it. \n\nAfter 4th or 6th grade (depending on the state) kids are traditionally seperated into three school:\n\nHauptschule (until 10th grade)\nRealschule (until 10th grade)\nGymnasium (until 12th grade that qualifies for attending university)\n\nBut there is also a version called Gesamtschule where all the above mentioned schooling paths can be taken.\n\nEither way if your kids struggle in their early years of school and are send to Haupt- or Realschule then it's not impossible to catch up over time and still get the accreditation to attend university by switching schools after 10th grade or going to a Oberschule.\n\nHowever going to university is not necessary to make a good living. You can also make an apprenticeship after 10th grade to start into work live as a qualified worker.\n\nAll that being said, if you are moving to a big city there are international schools that don't teach mainly in German.\n\nI would still strongly urge you to invest in some quality language tutoring for your kids before you move just to make the transition easier for them."

    "input": "Why do Germans keep explaining my jokes back to me?. \n\nBeen living in Germany for 3 months now/had some German friends prior. I have noticed that almost every time I crack a joke people go \"haha so you mean that *insert detailed explanation of the premise and the kicker* haha\". I have never encountered this kind of behavior anywhere else in the world. Is this normal? Or is my sense of humor just different and people are simply trying to understand what I'm joking about?",
    "output": "Do you tell the jokes in German or in English?\n\nI think the part you're missing is: Jokes are one of THE most difficult things to understand as a non-native or translate. Reasons:\n\n\\- Jokes base on a very **quick and skilled understanding of the words** or phrases - often not as good in non-natives, and significant because the funniness of the joke is the surprise. Also, in other situations you have the context of the rest of the text or sentence to make up for some knowledge gaps or insecurities - in jokes you absolutely rely on your solid knowledge for the joke to work\n\n\\- Often, jokes have some **collective cultural background/knowledge** which may be different in different populations\n\n\\- Different countries have a different **sense of humor** in what is allowed to be joked about or how jokes are \"designed\" so your \"sense of humor\" which you may perceive as \"universal\" is actually *specific* to a certain culture\n\nIf you tell someone a joke who's not a native speaker of your language, they are going to be challenged a LOT more than in everyday talk or than native speakers. If you tell a joke in a different language, people might focus on understanding you despite of your accent or cultural difference so that their attention is not as \"present\" for a joke.\n\nPersonally, I see myself as rather advanced in English and two other languages, I can read linguistically challenging books in all three languages better than some native speakers with less academic background, and STILL, not understanding jokes is not uncommon - either because I have an idea of the double meaning of a word/phrase but I'm not completely certain (unless the context is clear), there's some cultural knowledge I lack, etcetera etcetera.\n\nTLDR: Jokes are linguistically, and often culturally, VERY challenging for non-native speakers. You might not be aware if you're not experienced with learning languages."

Beyond that, what is surprising to me as a cynic, so far the national effort to reduce gas consumption has worked pretty well, in the first half of 2022 we already reduced gas usage by 15% compared to the year prior, and consider that that the earliest two months of that is both the time when everybody still thought things were going to blow over in Ukraine and also the coldest, i.e., gas consumption was highest. This is indicative that we will indeed be able to massively reduce gas consumption in the critical months. \n\nMany people will also tell you that there is a uniquely German pride in being well prepared for shit, and I think that's one of those clich√©s that do have a certain basis in reality, I do believe we are famous for our affintiy towards all-weather jackets and shoes. I'm just some random ass student in a one room appartment, but I have taken certain steps to heat more effectively and insulate my appartment better when the time comes and I'll be going for the minimum possible electricity and heating consumption no matter what happens because I'm already all geared up for it and by this point I just want to know how much I can save. \"Strom sparen\" and \"Heizungskosten sparen\" (saving heating and electricity costs) is, oddly enough, somewhat of a nationally beloved pastime and people can be really anal about it without any material necessity for being frugal whatsoever. Imagine a nation consisting solely of dads hell bent on protecting the thermostat from tampering hands even at the cost of violence towards their own families. It's not quite as bad, but it is still definitely a noticeable widespread trait, as any exchange student who has ever been accused of showering too long, being wasteful with heating or energy, or not properly separating the trash will most certainly attest to (any anecdtoes here?). Heck, the last shared living arrangement I was in I got in regular, screaming-at-the-top-of-my-lungs, fights with my flatmate over being wasteful with energy and heating, and the accusations went both ways, it's not like one was accusing and the other defending, no, we were fighting over who was being more wasteful (not my proudest moment, but it illustrates my point nicely, so...). \n\nLet's also not forget that there is still a solid chance the crisis won't come. I think it'd be dumb to put your eggs in the basket of just assuming everything will somehow turn out (another thing I suspect is more in line with a general German attitude of preparedness and many think likewise), but really, there's a huge chance we will avoid it If I'd be a betting person, I'd bet on us avoiding it while still being prepared for it happening. I'm currently very interested in the outcome of Habeck's talks in Canada. I think him being in that position has done a lot to mitigate potential panic, he has ben making a good, if not great, impression in managing this clusterfuck of a situation. And on a final cynical note: we've had a tendency to come out on top of the big economic crisis (crises? crisises? crisi?) of the past decades, not rarely at the expense of some of our european neighors. I'm certain that when push comes to shove a certain \"yes, we're all in this together but right now let's look out for ourselves\" mentality will kick in. Whatever the crisis ahead, much like the war in general, it's other people getting and will get the worst of it."

I can see how the argument works when it is claimed \"the waiver of 1953 that Poland would not want reparations is not binding because it has no democratic legitimacy as it was done by a dictatorship under the boot of the USSR.\" I find it to have some merit - under some caviats, such as that it would have worked if the young democracy would have started the claims. But the third Polish Republic  is now 33 years old. It is older than reunified Germany. They had their time to claim. That they do it **now** just unmasks their true intentions. 77 years after the war has ended."

We still insist on giving it a German pronunciation which ends up sounding a lot like \"ficken\" (or so I have been told by a few German speakers).\n\n\nEDIT: Sorry for not being clear, my question is more a curiosity: If I told you my American last name, could you figure out how it should really be spelt/pronounced in German? (I'm not trying to change my name legally at all)\n\nEDIT: My last name here in America if Fiecke. My family and I pronounce it like \"fee-key.\" The first Fiecke to come over was illiterate and dictated his name to an immigration officer. That officer probably heard him say \"Fike,\" \"Fich,\" or \"Fiche\" so he wrote it as Fiecke with the intent that it would be said with an English pronunciation instead of a German one.",
    "output": "To a native German reader Fiecke sounds absolutely fine. I'd illustrate the pronunciation in English as Fee-ke: long e in the beginning (just like in tuition fee), super short one in the end (like the ke in kettle).\n\nSo if you say \"tuition fee kettle\", your name is right in the middle in almost its German pronounciation."

    "output": "I really love living in Germany and don't regret moving here; in fact it feels like every day is an adventure and I can't really see myself leaving.\n\nThat said, there are some annoying things here and there:\n\n* bureaucracy\n* total lack of digitalization and insistence on using paper forms for everything\n* while I appreciate the directness of Germans, which makes resolving conflicts in both the professional and personal sphere much easier, some people abuse this by being assholes and then covering it up with \"I'm just being direct\"\n* on a similar note, while I appreciate that people follow the rules, there are of course people who abuse this by crossing the line from insisting that you follow the rules to mean-spirited pedantry (and a similar cover-up attempt with \"well if you'd just follow the rules, I wouldn't have to be so mean to you\", etc.)\n* a strong normative bias at both the micro and macro level. In politics, government, business, and on the personal level, there can be an extremely strong resistance to change, even when it is clearly warranted. There is also an attitude of \"the way things are now is how they are naturally meant to be\" and this leads to a lack of critical self-reflection on whether something is truly a good idea or could backfire in the future.\n   * one clear example: during the vaccination campaigns in 2021, the vaccination centers were closed on Sundays because of the Sunday work ban. I appreciate the Sunday work ban and common day off, but this was very clearly a crisis that was killing hundreds of people every day and frustrated those of us who wanted to get vaccinated quickly. I don't understand why an exception wasn't made for vaccinations to be done on Sundays other than rigid conformism to The Rules^(TM)\n* there's no kitchen when you move into a new apartment, you have to buy one when you move in and then take it with you when you leave (seriously wtf is this?)\n* I appreciate that diligence, conscientiousness, and quality are valued when it comes to work, but there can also be a strong tendency to over-engineer and over-complicate things unnecessarily\n* How widespread smoking and public intoxication are\n* Customer service culture is really bad. The customer is treated as an active hinderance to doing business. I don't need over the top service or to be best friends with restaurant staff or store clerks or customer service agents, but I would appreciate it a bit more if there was more focus on providing an actual solution when something goes wrong\n\nBut again: most of these things are minor irritants or frustrations that are more than cancelled out by the things I like about Germany"

With him, the term Realpolitik was coined, because he could easily switch political friends and enemies when he saw it as the better route to take for day to day politics. But this is also why he saw war as just another mean of foreign politics. He also wasn't shying back from keeping the emperor in the dark about his actions.\n\nTo me he at school he was often described as a man who didn't quite fit into the time anymore, as soon as Wilhelm II came to power. While he certainly would have kept Germany's political and socioeconomic progress back (he despised the thought of a true democracy)  if he had stayed in power for longer, his lack of interest in colonialism (coining the term of the \"saturated Germany\") and persistence on not offending the British Empire, would certainly have pervented an event like WWI. At least, that's what I remember from school nearly two decades ago.\n\nAs for his heritage, I'd say he's mainly remembered as the father of the German welfare state, even though he only introduced the reforms just as a ruse to fight the social democrats."

A lot of time in history classes is spent on discussion, not lecturing.\n\nThis is why you will find people here saying \"He implemented social security and was an important figure in German unification.\" You will not find people in this thread saying \"He was a great guy\", because that's not how Germans tend to deal with history in school."

But it seemed as we truly got into the Internet age, the Germans were less on the bleeding edge, although they retained their manufacturing superiority.\n\nWhy was this?\n\nIt seems like the Germans had everything.\n\nGood capital markets. Education system that had both academic and vocational training. Lots of English speakers. A big domestic market, plus the huge EU market. Productive relations betwen management and trade unions. Excellent relations with the USA, in fact with most countries. You see little Estonia doing well and the UK too has some digital champions--that wind up getting purchased. . .\n\nWhat happened with Germany?\n\nWe Americans have a \"pro-German\" prejudice if anything, so this is surprising given Germany's long, impressive industrial history. . . but it seems a bit behind in the information revolution: how come?

For the longest time, you could only get any financing if your company was working with heavy machinery or similar hardware - so stuff that can be repoed.

Germany was on the very forefront of the digital revolution - but only in terms of knowledge, not when it came to companies, infrastructure or products. The programming and hacking scene was booming in Germany and still is, just look at the CCC, but it's not fostered so talent usually moves to better pay."

    "output": "I find it hard to really answer your questions without knowing anything about the character and the plot.\n\nJust some random, spontaneous thoughts:\n\n* If he's from Baden-W√ºrttemberg - where exactely? North-Baden, South-Baden, Swabia, ...? Depending on that, his dialect will be different. And he would definitely speak dialect coming from a farm in the South. Depending on that, he might also be from a small mountain-village or from the very flat Upper Rhine Plain. He might come from the border to France or Switzerland, or Bavaria or Rheinland-Pfalz... How far away was the next bigger city - was it Stuttgart, Freiburg, Mannheim, Karlsruhe? Or is his farm even more rural? From what I know, there are cherry farms South of Stuttgart, close to Esslingen, and further South close to the Lake Constance. So that would be Swabia.\n* But if you're from the US and have never been to Germany: Keep in mind that Germany is a very densly populated country. It's not like in the US where you can drive a straight road for hours and see no one. You drive for 5-10 minutes and you're in the next town/village. Almost everywhere.\n* The South tends to be richer than many other parts of Germany, with Mercedes, Porsche, Bosch etc.. But that might not apply for farms.\n* What would interest me: How did a half-Egyptian end up in a Southern German cherry farm? Did he inherit it from his parents or marry into it? Does he look Egyptian and maybe even face the everyday racism or did he grow up super German with traditions like Christmas, Nikolaus, Fastnacht/Fasching, and St. Martins-Umzug? Did he grow up in an environment where immigration backgrounds are normal or was he the only kid with a non-German parent? Or does this part of the story not matter at all?\n* And why did he join the military? What are his / his family's political views? What's his level of education - did he go to Hauptschule and did an Ausbildung/Lehre, or did he go to Gymnasium and study at university before going to the military?\n* I wouldn't write dialogues in a strong accent, I find that it tends to sound weird. Maybe a light accent with \"s\" instead of \"th\" could be ok."

    "output": "So much misinformation here, sorry.\n(Not a lawyer, not your lawyer but someone that has a degree in a law field)\n\nI think you are well aware by now that you should never talk to the cops voluntarily and that you basically confessed a crime - which is rarely a good idea without a lawyer.\nFor the sake of this post I also establish that you are over 21.\n\nYou now face two different problems:\nFirst you face criminal charges, not only for the punch to the head but also for the \"wrestling\" beforehand.\n\nDepending on the exact circumstances of the case you have either committed bodily harm (¬ß223 StGb) or, if there is more that is not mentioned here, maybe dangerous bodily harm (¬ß224 StGb). \n\nThe difference is significant: \nWhile \"bodily harm\" is \"only\" set up with a maximum penalty of 5 years of prison time or fines and no minimum penalty (this becomes important later) for \"dangerous bodily harm\" the law requires a minimum sentence of 6 month and allows a maximum sentence of 10 years AND does not mention a fine anymore.\nThe difference in your case might be: \n\nHave you used or tried to use any accessory tool in the assault that could be seen as a makeshift weapon? This includes a pair of keys OR a kick to the head or (to a lesser extend) other body party, especially the torso, with your foot with boots or shoes on (both count as a weapon here)? \n\nHave you jumped your opponent from behind while he was still arguing with your mother?\n\nHas she taken part or tried to do so in the use of any force against the opponent?\n\nIn all those cases you might be tried for dangerous bodily harm - which complicates things quite a bit.\n\nNow, in terms of lawyers: In the German criminal court system it is only mandatory to have a lawyer for any offense that carry a minimal sentence of one year or above - and only then you will be assigned a public prosecutor if you are unable to pay for a lawyer.\nThis means in theory you could self defend yourself. Which is a an absolute terrible idea none should ever try. Not even (good) lawyers do that.\nAlso note: A Rechtsschutzversicherung wouldn't cover this case at all - you committed a willful assault,that is legally not part of the Rechtsschutz. And a public defender will in almost all cases also cost the defendant money. \n\nIn other words: Lawyer up!\nYou have no idea what charges the prosecutor will press. \n\nThe good news is:\nIt is VERY unlikely that you have to go to jail if this is your first offence.\nWhat will likely happen:\nA) The public prosecutor doesn't see it as a case of enough public interest to push charges and the case is dismissed. \nMore likely if you are in or around a big city with a overworked prosecutors office, not that likely in smaller prosecutors offices. \nNot that likely in that case,but can happen.\n\nB) The public prosecutors office applies for a summary judgement(Strafbefehl). This means there will be no actual hearing but a judge will rule on it without hearing much of your side and only by the documents and results the prosecutor presents. You can then either accept or decline and request full trial. \nIn my opinion this is the most likely outcome - but the one where an lawyer will be most beneficial, as they do not produce high costs in these cases but can significantly alter the punishment here. Note that a summary judgement is still a proper criminal judgement against you. \n\nC) The prosecutor decides to go into a full on trial. This will either happen because you have enough evidence against you that the Prosecutor wants more punishment than the summary judgement allows OR he is not sure enough about getting his summary judgement recommendation past the judge.\nIn that case you also will need a lawyer but it's a bit more expensive.\n\nIt is NOT an option to wait what happens now and simply pay a fine - the option A) is the last one to happen and especially B) is happening without too much interaction with you know and you will get served one day - and then it is too late.\n\nAdditionally the victim has the right to become its own part of the proceedings and can absolutely try to prevent A and B. Additionally if you are found guilty in B and C the costs of this proceedings are also yours to bear. And they can fuck you over badly by pushing lawyer costs and expert witnesses to the max. \n\nAnd of course if you are found guilty you also have to pay for the costs of the court which again is not cheap. \n\nSo for the love of Justicia, please lawyer up.\nIt is the cheapest option now. \n\nAs it was mentioned here: \nGermany has a centralised criminal record.\nAll(!) judgements by a criminal court get registered there. BUT: Not everyone has access and they get automatically deleted after a certain time period without any further judgements against you.\nNormal employer will only see fines above 90 Tagess√§tze (daily rate fines), and for a much shorter time than government organisations can. They order a different record from the database that contains more data and for longer. \nThis is not only done if you apply for a high security clearance job (that the government has to background check you for even if the job is with a private company, e.g a defense firm) or a government entity, but also when applying for a regulated job (e.g. paramedic,nurse) or licence (guns for example) or when dealing with the Ausl√§nderbeh√∂rde (!).\nWhile a single judgement that is rather small is unlikely to cause you too much concern here a otherwise difficult backstory or an asshole of an decision maker at the Beh√∂rde can get you in a lot of trouble.\n\nSo you definitely want to lawyer up to keep the entry there as small and insignificant as possible - the alternative is much more costly.\n\nNow to the other part:\nThe civil law: the other side can and likely will also sue you for damages. That will include penalties due to injuries (not that significant in Germany), lost wages (expensive, a punch to the head is advised to be off work for two weeks often to let the concussion heal) and additionally the victims health care costs as well as associated costs (e.g. dental work, physiotherapy for a strained neck, the taxi to the physio,etc.). Additionally you will also be liable for the other sides legal costs in most cases. This adds up fast. \nThe proceedings here are heavily influenced by the results of the criminal case though (and in theory both cases can be somewhat joined which makes it cheaper- which would require a lawyer on your realistically), so getting an optimal result there is paramount to reduce costs.\n\nBTW: With \"paying\" I mean \"they will make you pay\". It's not only that they check everything you currently have or earn, they (state and victim) would also be able to foreclose parts of your private property (e.g. a PlayStation) - until you payed all debts including interest. \nAnd they will do so for 30 years and have ways to enforce this in a lot of countries world wide. \nYou cannot declare bankruptcy over that,btw.\nDo not mess with them.\n\nIn the end you really do have a problem and this fuckups will cost you around 10k I recon.

    "output": "First: It is true, that the equivalent term \"deutsch-franz√∂sisches Paar\" is used not that often on the eastern side of the border.\n\nBut: The relationship between France and Germany is normally called otherwise over here, like \"Deutsch-Franz√∂sische Freundschaft\" (amiti√© franco-allemande) or \"Deutsch-Franz√∂sischer Motor\" (moteur franco-allemand).\n\nWhile one could consider the word \"couple\" to be strongest in the emotional meaning (\"'till death parts us\"), you can also see a quite deep meaning in \"friendship\" or \"motor\". Those two words used more often in Germany are not meant to be disrespectful or in a way to lower the meaning of the French and German relationship. I guess, the term \"motor\" has just been more convenient in Germany in the past, since quite a big chunk of the German wealth resulted and still results from the invention and use of the motor (Germans and romance ... yeah).\n\nAlso try to interpret it that way: Couples sometimes just stick together not because they love each other longer but because they have to since separating would cause trouble or financial risks. A friendship on the other side is kept by the free intention of both sides and sometimes lasts longer than a marriage.\n\nTl;dr: There are similar but slightly different terms used over here.

We had screens at the office entrances showing the current reliability stats. You are confronted with it every single day, and if a train is delayed, that usually means overtime for the people working on it, who are not happy about it either. \n\nThere are lots of good answers here already, but I just want to emphasize that running Germany's main rail network means coordinating the actions of over a hundred thousand people, every day, across hundreds of subcompanies, using equipment and infrastructure that may be a hundred years old, and that is accessible to anyone and anything. Sabotage, people on tracks, debris thrown into the path of trains moving at 300 km an hour, rocks, trees, animals... sometimes I'm amazed any train gets anywhere on time.\n\nDoes that excuse the unreliability and delays? No, it doesn't. That's just something DB is responsible for (and I'm as fed up with it as anyone else). But if people want to stand up and say \"how hard can it be\", well, you're invited to try for yourself. DB has a personnel shortage, they hire 20.000 new employees every year, and they offer good conditions. If anyone wants to be the hero that saves the nation, step up and show us what you can do."

So all in all, people have less expectations? They do the maths, figure out the budget they have for housing and then look for something within their budget. That may mean less sqm, a different location, a smaller/older bathroom, no balcony, no basement/storage room, etc. They compromise.\n\nAnd yes, sadly the reality for many is that they indeed pay more than 30% of their net income for housing."

    "output": "I don't know but makes sense to me (as somebody who is learning the language for a while now and maybe got a deeper view into the culture than many others except people who traveled a lot in Japan or lived there).\n\nAt first, Japan is a rich country. It's been developed and wealthy for a very long time. So Japanese people don't get Germans for money or a visa.\n\nBut Japan is a collectivist society. People generally don't stray too far away from the norm. Even in anonymous surveys people will flat out lie if their views are not actually aligned with the collective. It's only the internet where Japanese people go crazy. If you think twitter cancel culture is bad, Japanese internet culture is a million times worse but it's 4chan (literally a clone of nichan) kind of internet culture.\n\nJapan is also not the most progressive country. The culture values tradition and age. \"hard work\" is a function of time spent at work not productive output.\n\nSo you have a society that is less open to \"career women\" because of tradition, has a lot of people stuck on 14h work days and then you have women you might want children at some point. So what do you do? Your husband is statistically earning more than you will. You can't both work full time. Working less than that is seen as lazy. So you'd have to give up your career for a child.\n\nAnd then comes the German.\n\nHe is probably taller than Japanese men\n\nHe is probably more hairy than Japanese men \n\nHe is probably having a naturally exotic eye and hair color\n\nHe is probably generally seen as exotic just because Japan is not a very diverse country\n\nHe is probably having views that are against the collective viewpoint of society and not afraid to voice them.\n\nI don't think German culture is that comparable to Japanese culture. Even if we value the same things the implementation seems to be very different.\n\nAll of those points are things that make you stand out as a German in Japan. If a Japanese person values any of this or is bored by any of this or annoyed by any of this might see exactly what they look for in a German man.\n\nTorn between career and children and really likes beards when she sees them in western media? The German is a good fit.\n\nReally into blond hair and blue eye and annoyed that old people get a free pass for any shitty behavior just because they're old? The German is a good fit.\n\nTaller than average women in Japan but likes their man to be taller than her and also super bored because every date they've been on was basically the same conversation with the same opinion? Oh look at that tall German man has totally different opinions!\n\nReally likes the louder, more outgoing character that Germans tend to have more than Japanese people and also really wished they could live in a country where they get enough paid time off to travel the world? German it is.\n\nIn every society, different is sexy. And those are some things that make Germans different that might get a relationship off the ground easier than if you date people that look and behave like you.\n\nAlso, how old are your colleagues? If they are in their mid 20s to mid 30s, they might also have spend time in Japan during a time where a good chunk of people get into relationships that lead to marriage. You had your fun, you know what you want from a relationship, you know if you even want to get married and if you want children the biological clock might be ticking as well. The next relationship you get into might be exactly the relationship you wish your marriage would be like.\n\nIn conclusion: they just love each other. You just get some bonus points as a white dude in Japan that make dating easier. That gets you on more dates and if your wife doesn't mind living in Europe or even prefers it at least for a while, they just come back to Germany as a married couple."

    "output": "It's a mix of both. I'm not ugly or anything, but according to European standards pretty average. Ever since I moved to Asia, the interest of women in me more than quadrupled.\n\nNow I had similar success living in Africa for the 5 years before coming to Asia, but there any westerners are seen as walking ATMs that can lift the whole family out of poverty single-handedly, while in Asia, they are often highly educated women and their families are frowning upon their liaison with foreigners.\n\nMany Asian women are raised in particularly hierarchical societies and patriarchal households. Doesn't help that child rearing is often the job of the grandparents, which means that the modern values need even longer to take hold. Now, educated women soon learn that in \"the west\" they are treated as equals and not as objects. Asia is a far cry better than the middle east, but still not even close to where we're at.\n\nAt the same time, white skin, non-black eyes and hair and tall bodies are considered high beauty standards, so we are desirable to them. And Asian beauty standards for women often means as skinny as possible (I have a colleague who's 171cm and weighs under 42 kg, the guys in my office are all but salivating), as pale as possible (hence you often see Asian women walking around with parasols all day) and have an as long and as narrow as possible face shape. Think Camilla Parker Bowls, aka the horse queen.\n\nWhich means that in retrospect, a healthy looking, slightly tanned girl with a rounder face - super attractive to westerners - looks ugly to Asian men.\n\nAnd that's how your average German dude scores a smart Asian beauty."

Yes. But I still feel like it gives a better chance at a specialised education than several other models."
